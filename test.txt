rust seemed to map blood seas on the black pocked surface of mocks vane a century old it squatted on the point of an old pike that had been bolted to the outer top of the holds wall monstrous and misshapen it had been coldhammered into the form of a winged demon teeth bared in a leering grin and was tugged and buffeted in squealing protest with every gust of windthe winds were contrary the day columns of smoke rose over the mouse quarter of malaz city the vanes silence announced the sudden fallingoff of the sea breeze that came clambering over the ragged walls of mocks hold then it creaked back into life as the hot sparkscattered and smokefilled breath of the mouse quarter reached across the city to sweep the promontorys heightsganoes stabro paran of the house of paran stood on tiptoe to see over the merlon behind him rose mocks hold once capital of the empire but now since the mainland had been conquered relegated once more to a fists holding to his left rose the pike and its wayward trophyfor ganoes the ancient fortification overlooking the city was too familiar to be of interest this visit was his third in as many years hed long ago explored the courtyard with its heaved cobblestones the old keepnow a stable its upper floor home to pigeons and swallows and batsand the citadel where even now his father negotiated the island export tithe with the harbour officials in the last instance of course a goodly portion was out of bounds even for a son of a noble house for it was in the citadel that the fist had his residence and in the inner chambers that such affairs of the empire as concerned this island were conductedmocks hold forgotten behind him ganoes attention was on the tattered city below and the riots that ran through its poorest quartermocks hold stood atop a cliff the higher land of the pinnacle was reached by a switchback staircase carved into the limestone of the cliff wall the drop to the city below was eighty armspans or more with the holds battered wall adding still another six the mouse was at the citys inland edge an uneven spreading of hovels and overgrown tiers cut in half by the siltheavy river that crawled towards the harbour with most of malaz city between ganoes position and the riots it was hard to make out any detail beyond the growing pillars of black smokeit was midday but the flash and thundering concussion of magery made the air seem dark and heavyarmour clanking a soldier appeared along the wall near him the man leaned vambraced forearms on the battlement the scabbard of his longsword scraping against the stones glad for your pure blood eh he asked grey eyes on the smouldering city belowthe boy studied the soldier he already knew the complete regimental accoutrements of the imperial army and the man at his side was a commander in the thirdone of the emperors own an elite on his dark grey shouldercloak was a silver brooch a bridge of stone lit by ruby flames a bridgeburnerhighranking soldiers and officials of the empire commonly passed through mocks hold the island of malaz remained a vital port of call especially now that the korel wars to the south had begun ganoes had brushed shoulders with more than his share here and in the capital untais it true then ganoes asked boldlyis what truethe first sword of empire dassem ultor we heard in the capital before we left hes dead is it true is dassem deadthe man seemed to flinch his gaze unwavering on the mouse such is war he muttered under his breath as if the words were not meant for anyone elses earsyoure with the third i thought the third was with him in seven cities at yghatanhoods breath theyre still looking for his body in the stillhot rubble of that damned city and here you are a merchants son three thousand leagues from seven cities with information only a few are supposed to possess he still did not turn i know not your sources but take my advice and keep what you know to yourselfganoes shrugged its said he betrayed a godfinally the man faced him his face was scarred and something that might have been a burn marred his jaw and left cheek for all that he looked young for a commander heed the lesson there sonwhat lessonevery decision you make can change the world the best life is the one the gods dont notice you want to live free boy live quietlyi want to be a soldier a heroyoull grow out of itmocks vane squealed as a wayward gust from the harbour cleared the grainy smoke ganoes could now smell rotting fish and the waterfronts stink of humanityanother bridgeburner this one with a broken scorched fiddle strapped to his back came up to the commander he was wiry and if anything youngeronly a few years older than ganoes himself who was twelve strange pockmarks covered his face and the backs of his hands and his armour was a mixture of foreign accoutrements over a threadbare stained uniform a shortsword hung in a cracked wooden scabbard at his hip he leaned against the merlon beside the other man with the ease of long familiarityits a bad smell when sorcerers panic the newcomer said theyre losing control down there hardly the need for a whole cadre of mages just to sniff out a few waxwitchesthe commander sighed thought to wait to see if theyd rein themselves inthe soldier grunted they are all new untested this could scar some of them for ever besides he added more than a few down there are following someone elses ordersa suspicion no morethe proofs right there the other man said in the mouseperhapsyoure too protective the man said surly says its your greatest weaknesssurlys the emperors concern not minea second grunt answered that maybe all of us before too longthe commander was silent slowly turning to study his companionthe man shrugged just a feeling shes taking a new name you know laseenlaseennapan word meansi know what it meanshope the emperor does tooganoes said it means thronemasterthe two looked down at himthe wind shifted again making the iron demon groan on its percha smell of cool stone from the hold itself my tutors napan ganoes explaineda new voice spoke behind them a womans imperious and coldcommanderboth soldiers turned but without haste the commander said to his companion the new company needs help down there send dujek and a wing and get some sappers to contain the fireswouldnt do to have the whole city burnthe soldier nodded marched away sparing the woman not a single glanceshe stood with two bodyguards near the portal in the citadels square tower her dusky blue skin marked her as napan but she was otherwise plain wearing a saltstained grey robe her mousy hair cut short like a soldiers her features thin and unmemorable it was however her bodyguards that sent a shiver through ganoes they flanked her tall swathed in black hands hidden in sleeves hoods shadowing their faces ganoes had never seen a claw before but he instinctively knew these creatures to be acolytes of the cult which meant the woman wasthe commander said its your mess surly seems ill have to clean it upganoes was shocked at the absence of fearthe nearcontempt in the soldiers voice surly had created the claw making it a power rivalled only by the emperor himselfthat is no longer my name commanderthe man grimaced so ive heard you must be feeling confident in the emperors absence hes not the only one who remembers you as nothing more than a servingwench down in the old quarter i take it the gratitudes washed off long sincethe womans face betrayed no change of expression to mark if the mans words had stung the command was a simple one she said it seems your new officers are unable to cope with the taskits got out of hand the commander said theyre unseasonednot my concern she snapped nor am i particularly disappointed loss of control delivers its own lessons to those who oppose usoppose a handful of minor witches selling their meagre talentsto what sinister endfinding the coraval schools on the shoals in the bayhoods breath woman hardly a threat to the empireunsanctioned defiant of the new lawsyour laws surly they wont work and when the emperor returns hell quash your prohibition of sorcery you can be certain of thatthe woman smiled coldly youll be pleased to know that the towers signalled the approach of the transports for your new recruits well not miss you or your restless seditious soldiers commanderwithout another word or a single glance spared for the boy standing beside the commander she swung about and flanked by her silent bodyguards reentered the citadelganoes and the commander returned their attention to the riot in the mouse flames were visible climbing through the smokeone day ill be a soldier ganoes saidthe man grunted only if you fail at all else son taking up the sword is the last act of desperate men mark my words and find yourself a more worthy dreamganoes scowled youre not like the other soldiers ive talked to you sound more like my fatherbut im not your father the man growledthe world ganoes said doesnt need another izrine merchant the commanders eyes narrowed gauging he opened his mouth to make the obvious reply then shut it againganoes paran looked back down at the burning quarter pleased with himself even a boy commander can make a pointmocks vane swung once more hot smoke rolled over the wall engulfing them a reek of burning cloth scorched paint and stone and now of something sweet an abattoirs caught fire ganoes said pigsthe commander grimaced after a long moment he sighed and leaned back down on the merlon as you say boy as you sayin the eighth year the free cities of genabackis established contracts with a number of mercenary armies to oppose the imperiums advance prominent among these were the crimson guard under the command of prince kazz davore see volumes iii amp v and the tiste and regiments of moons spawn under the command of caladan brood and othersthe forces of the malazan empire commanded by high fist dujek onearm consisted in that year of the nd th and th armies as well as legions of moranthin retrospect two observations can be made the first is that the moranth alliance of  marked a fundamental change in the science of warfare for the malazan imperium which would prove efficacious in the short term the second observation worth noting is that the involvement of the sorcerous tiste and of moons spawn represented the beginning of the continents sorcery enfilade with devastating consequencesin the year of burns sleep  the siege of pale ended with a now legendary sorcerous conflagration imperial

empire th year of empress laseens ruleprod and pull the old woman was saying its the way of the empress as like the gods themselves she leaned to one side and spat then brought a soiled cloth to her wrinkled lips three husbands and two sons i saw off to warthe fishergirls eyes shone as she watched the column of mounted soldiers thunder past and she only half listened to the hag standing beside her the girls breath had risen to the pace of the magnificent horses she felt her face burning a flush that had nothing to do with the heat the day was dying the suns red smear over the trees on her right and the seas sighing against her face had grown coolthat was in the days of the emperor the hag continued hood roast the bastards soul on a spit but look on lass laseen scatters bones with the best of them heh she started with his didnt she nowthe fishergirl nodded faintly as befitted the lowborn they waited by the roadside the old woman burdened beneath a rough sack filled with turnips the girl with a heavy basket balanced on her head every minute or so the old woman shifted the sack from one bony shoulder to the otherwith the riders crowding them on the road and the ditch behind them a steep drop to broken rocks she had no place to put down the sackscatters bones i said bones of husbands bones of sons bones of wives and bones of daughters all the same to her all the same to the empire the old woman spat a second time three husbands and two sons ten coin apiece a year five of tens fifty fifty coin a years cold company lass cold in winter cold in bedthe fishergirl wiped dust from her forehead her bright eyes darted among the soldiers passing before her the young men atop their highbacked saddles held expressions stern and fixed straight ahead the few women who rode among them sat tall and somehow fiercer than the men the sunset cast red glints from their helms flashing so that the girls eyes stung and her vision blurredyoure the fishermans daughter the old woman said i seen you afore on the road and down on the strand seen you and your dad at market missing an arm aint he more bones for her collection is likely eh she made a chopping motion with one hand then nodded mines the first house on the track i use the coin to buy candles five candles i burn every night five candles to keep old rigga company its a tired house full of tired things and me one of them lass what you got in the basket there slowly the fishergirl realized that a question had been asked of her she pulled her attention from the soldiers and smiled down at the old woman im sorry she said

waters took it and a whole catch too grand lender wants the money he loaned us and we need a catch tomorrow a good one she smiled again and swept her gaze back to the soldiers isnt it wonderful she breathedriggas hand shot out and snagged the girls thick black hair yanked it hardthe girl cried out the basket on her head lurched then slid down on to one shoulder she grabbed frantically for it but it was too heavy the basket struck the ground and split apart aaai the girl gasped attempting to kneel but rigga pulled and snapped her head aroundyou listen to me lass the old womans sour breath hissed against the girls face the empires been grinding this land down for a hundred years you was born in it i wasnt when i was your age itko kan was a country we flew a banner and it was ours we were free lassthe girl was sickened by riggas breath she squeezed shut her eyesmark this truth child else the cloak of lies blinds you for everriggas voice took on a droning cadence and all at once the girl stiffened rigga riggalai the seer the waxwitch who trapped souls in candles and burned them souls devoured in flameriggas words carried the chilling tone of prophecy mark this truth i am the last to speak to you you are the last to hear me thus are we linked you and i beyond all elseriggas fingers snagged tighter in the girls hair across the sea the empress has driven her knife into

rock on the roads edge turned underfoot and she fell when she looked up the outrider had trotted pastanother thundered up in his wakeleave the pretty one alone hag this one growled and as he rode by he leaned in his saddle and swung an open gauntleted hand the ironscaled glove cracked against riggas head spinning her around she toppledthe fishergirl screamed as rigga landed heavily across her thighs a bead of crimson spit spattered her face whimpering the girl pushed herself back across the gravel then used her feet to shove away riggas body she climbed to her kneessomething within riggas prophecy seemed lodged in the girls head heavy as a stone and hidden from light she found she could not retrieve a single word the seer had said she reached out and grasped riggas woollen shawl carefully she rolled the old woman over blood covered one side of riggas head running down behind the ear more blood smeared her lined chin and stained her mouth the eyes stared sightlesslythe fishergirl pulled back unable to catch her breath desperate she looked about the column of soldiers had passed leaving nothing but dust and the distant tremble of hoofs riggas bag of turnips had spilled on to the road among the trampled vegetables lay five tallow candlesthe girl managed a ragged lungful of dusty air wiping her nose she looked to her own basketnever mind the candles she mumbled in a thick odd voice theyre gone arent they now just a scattering of bones never mind she crawled towards the bundles of twine that had fallen from the breached basket and when she spoke again her voice was young normal we need the twine well work all night and get one ready daddas waiting hes right at the door hes looking up the track hes waiting to see meshe stopped a shiver running through her the suns light was almost gone an unseasonal chill bled from the shadows which now flowed like water across the roadhere it comes then the girl grated softly in a voice that wasnt her owna softgloved hand fell on her shoulder she ducked down cowering easy girl said a mans voice its over nothing to be done for her nowthe fishergirl looked up a man swathed in black leaned over her his face obscured beneath a hoods shadow but he hit her the girl said in childs voice and we have nets to tie me and daddalets get you on your feet the man said moving his longfingered hands down under her arms he straightened lifting her effortlessly her sandalled feet dangled in the air before he set her downnow she saw a second man shorter also clothed in black this one stood on the road and was turned away his gaze in the direction the soldiers had gone he spoke his voice reedthin wasnt much of a life he said not turning to face her a minor talent long since dried up the gift oh she might have managed one more but well never know will wethe fishergirl stumbled over to riggas bag and picked up a candle she straightened her eyes suddenly hard then deliberately spat on to the roadthe shorter mans head snapped towards her within the hood seemed the shadows played alonethe girl shrank back a step it was a good life she whispered she had these candles you see five of them five fornecromancy the short man cut inthe taller man still at her side said softly i see them child i understand what they meanthe other man snorted the witch harboured five frail weak souls nothing grand he cocked his head i can hear them now calling for hertears filled the girls eyes a wordless anguish seemed to well up from that black stone in her mind she wiped her cheeks where did you come from she asked abruptly we didnt see you on the roadthe man beside her half turned to the gravel track on the other side he said a smile in his tone waiting just like youthe other giggled on the other side indeed he faced down the road again and raised his armsthe girl drew in a sharp breath as darkness descended a loud tearing sound filled the air for a second then the darkness dissipated and the girls eyes widenedseven massive hounds now sat around the man in the road the eyes of these beasts glowed yellow and all were turned in the same direction as the man himselfshe heard him hiss eager are we then go silently the hounds bolted down the roadtheir master turned and said to the man beside her something to gnaw on laseens mind he giggled againmust you complicate things the other answered wearilythe short man stiffened they are within sight of the columnhe cocked his head from up the road came the scream of horseshe sighed youve reached a decision cotillionthe other grunted amusedly using my name ammanas means youve just decided for me we can hardly leave her here now can weof course we can old friend just not breathingcotillion looked down on the girl no he said quietly shell dothe fishergirl bit her lip still clutching riggas candle she took another step back her wide eyes darting from one man to the otherpity ammanas saidcotillion seemed to nod then he cleared his throat and said itll take timean amused note entered ammanass reply and have we time true vengeance needs the slow careful stalking of the victim have you forgotten the pain she once delivered us laseens back is against the wall already she might fall without our help where would be the satisfaction in thatcotillions response was cool and dry youve always underestimated the empress hence our present circumstances no he gestured at the fishergirl well need this one laseens raised the ire of moons spawn and thats a hornets nest if ever there was one the timing is perfectfaintly above the screaming horses came the shrieks of men and women a sound that pierced the girls heart her eyes darted to riggas motionless form on the roadside then back to ammanas who now approached her she thought to run but her legs had weakened to a helpless trembling he came close and seemed to study her even though the shadows within his hood remained impenetrablea fishergirl he asked in a kindly toneshe noddedhave you a name enough cotillion growled shes not some mouse under your paw ammanas besides ive chosen her and i will choose her name as wellammanas stepped back pity he said againthe girl raised imploring hands please she begged cotillion ive done nothing my fathers a poor man but hell pay you all he can he needs me and the twinehes waiting right now she felt herself go wet between her legs and quickly sat down on the ground ive done nothing shame rose through her and she put her hands in her lappleaseive no choice any more child cotillion said after all you know our namesive never heard them before the girl criedthe man sighed with whats happening up the road right now well youd be questioned unpleasantly there are those who know our namesyou see lass ammanas added suppressing a giggle were not supposed to be here there are names and then there are names he swung to cotillion and said in a chilling voice her father must be dealt with my houndsno cotillion said he livesthen howi suspect cotillion said greed will suffice once the slate is wiped clean sarcasm filled his next words im sure you can manage the sorcery in that cant youammanas giggled beware of shadows bearing giftscotillion faced the girl again he lifted his arms out to the sides the shadows that held his features in darkness now flowed out around his bodyammanas spoke and to the girl his words seemed to come from a great distance shes ideal the empress could never track her down could never even so much as guess he raised his voice its not so bad a thing lass to be the pawn of a godprod and pull the fishergirl said quicklycotillion hesitated at her strange comment then he shrugged the shadows whirled out to engulf the girl with their cold touch her mind fell away down into darkness her last fleeting sensation was of the soft wax of the candle in her right hand and how it seemed to well up between the fingers of her clenched fistthe captain shifted in his saddle and glanced at the woman riding beside him weve closed the road on both sides adjunct moved the local traffic inland so far no words leaked he wiped sweat from his brow and winced the hot woollen cap beneath his helm had rubbed his forehead rawsomething wrong captainhe shook his head squinting up the road helmets loose had more hair the last time i wore itthe adjunct to the empress did not replythe midmorning sun made the roads white dusty surface almost blinding the captain felt sweat running down his body and the mail of his helms lobster tail kept nipping the hairs on his neck already his lower back ached it had been years since hed last ridden a horse and the roll was slow in coming with every saddlebounce he felt vertebrae crunchit had been a long time since somebodys title had been enough to straighten him up but this was the adjunct to the empress laseens personal servant an extension of her imperial will the last thing the captain wanted was to show his misery to this young dangerous womanup ahead the road began its long winding ascent a salty wind blew from their left whistling through the newly budding trees lining that side of the road by midafternoon that wind would breathe hot as a bakers oven carrying with it the stench of the mudflats and the suns heat would bring something else as well the captain hoped to be back in kan by thenhe tried not to think about the place they rode towards leave that to the adjunct in his years of service to the empire hed seen enough to know when to shut everything down inside his skull this was one of those timesthe adjunct spoke youve been stationed here long captainaye the man growledthe woman waited then asked how longhe hesitated thirteen years adjunctyou fought for the emperor then she saidayeand survived the purgethe captain threw her a look if she felt his gaze she gave no indicationher eyes remained on the road ahead she rolled easily in the saddle the scabbarded longsword hitched high under her left armready for mounted battle her hair was either cut short or drawn up under her helm her figure was lithe enough the captain musedfinished she asked i was asking about the purges commanded by empress laseen following her predecessors untimely deaththe captain gritted his teeth ducked his chin to draw up the helms straphe hadnt had time to shave and the buckle was chafing not everyone was killed adjunct the people of itko kan arent exactly excitable none of those riots and mass executions that hit other parts of the empire we all just sat tight and waitedi take it the adjunct said with a slight smile youre not nobleborn captainhe grunted if id been nobleborn i wouldnt have survived even here in itko kan we both know that her orders were specific and even the droll kanese didnt dare disobey the empress he scowled no up through the ranks adjunctyour last engagementwickan plainsthey rode on in silence for a time passing the occasional soldier stationed on the road off to their left the trees fell away to ragged heather and the sea beyond showed its whitecapped expanse the adjunct spoke this area youve contained how many of your guard have you deployed to patrol iteleven hundred the captain repliedher head turned at this her cool gaze tightening beneath the rim of her helmthe captain studied her expression the carnage stretches half a league from the sea adjunct and a quarterleague inlandthe woman said nothingthey approached the summit a score of soldiers had gathered there and others waited along the slopes rise all had turned to watch them prepare yourself adjunctthe woman studied the faces lining the roadside she knew these to be hardened men and women veterans of the siege of li heng and the wickan wars out on the north plains but something had been clawed into their eyes that had left them raw and exposed they looked upon her with a yearning that she found disturbing as if they hungered for answers she fought the urge to speak to them as she passed to offer whatever comforting words she could such gifts were not hers to give however nor had they ever been in this she was much the same as the empressfrom beyond the summit she heard the cries of gulls and crows a sound that rose into a highpitched roar as they reached the rise ignoring the soldiers on either side the adjunct moved her horse forward the captain followed they came to the crest and looked down the road dipped here for perhaps a fifth of a league climbing again at the far end to a promontorythousands of gulls and crows covered the ground spilling over into the ditches and among the low rough heather and gorse beneath this churning sea of black and white the ground was a uniform red here and there rose the ribbed humps of horses and from among the squalling birds came the glint of ironthe captain reached up and unstrapped his helm he lifted it slowly from his head then set it down over his saddle horn adjuncti am named lorn the woman said softlyone hundred and seventyfive men and women two hundred and ten horses the nineteenth regiment of the itko kanese eighth cavalrythe captains throat tightened briefly he looked at lorn dead his horse shied under him as it caught an updraught he closed savagely on the reins and the animal stilled nostrils wide and ears back muscles trembling under him the adjuncts stallion made no move all had their weapons bared all fought whatever enemy attacked them but the dead are all oursyouve checked the beach below lorn asked still staring down on the roadno signs of a landing the captain replied no tracks anywhere neither seaward nor inland there are more dead than these adjunct farmers peasants fisherfolk travellers on the road all of them torn apart limbs scatteredchildren livestock dogs he stopped abruptly and turned away over four hundred dead he grated were not certain of the exact countof course lorn said her tone devoid of feeling no witnessesnonea man was riding towards them on the road below leaning close to his horses ear as he talked the frightened animal through the carnagebirds rose in shrieking complaint in front of him settling again once he had passedwho is that the adjunct askedthe captain grunted lieutenant ganoes paran hes new to my command from untalorns eyes narrowed on the young man hed reached the edge of the depression stopping to relay orders to the work crews he leaned back in his saddle then and glanced in their direction paran from house paranaye gold in his veins and all thatcall him up herethe captain gestured and the lieutenant kicked his mounts flanksmoments later he reined in beside the captain and salutedthe man and his horse were covered from head to toe in blood and bits of flesh flies and wasps buzzed hungrily around them lorn saw in lieutenant parans face none of the youth that rightly belonged therefor all that it was an easy face to rest eyes uponyou checked the other side lieutenant the captain askedparan nodded yes sir theres a small fishing settlement down from the promontory a dozen or so huts bodies in all but two most of the barques look to be in though theres one empty mooring polelorn cut in lieutenant describe the empty hutshe batted at a threatening wasp before answering one was at the top of the strand just off the trail from the road we think it belonged to an old woman we found dead on the road about half a league south of herewhyadjunct the huts contents were that of an old woman also she seemed in the habit of burning candles tallow candles in fact the old woman on the road had a sack full of turnips and a handful of tallow candles tallows expensive here adjunctlorn asked how many times have you ridden through this battlefield lieutenantenough to be getting used to it adjunct he grimacedand the second empty huta man and a girl we think the huts close to the tidemark opposite the empty mooring poleno sign of themnone adjunct of course were still finding bodies along the road out in the fieldsbut not on the beachnothe adjunct frowned aware that both men were watching hercaptain what kind of weapons killed your soldiersthe captain hesitated then turned a glare on the lieutenant youve been crawling around down there paran lets hear your opinionparans answering smile was tight yes sir natural weaponsthe captain felt a sinking feeling in his stomach hed hoped hed been wrongwhat do you mean lorn asked natural weaponsteeth mostly very big very sharp onesthe captain cleared his throat then said there havent been wolves in itko kan for a hundred years in any case no carcasses aroundif it was wolves paran said turning to eye the basin they were as big as mules no tracks adjunct not even a tuft of hairnot wolves then lorn saidparan shruggedthe adjunct drew a deep breath held it then let it out in a slow sighi want to see this fishing villagethe captain made ready to don his helmet but the adjunct shook her head lieutenant paran will suffice captain i suggest you take personal command of your guard in the meantime the dead must be removed as quickly as possible all evidence of the massacre is to be erasedunderstood adjunct the captain said hoping hed kept the relief out of his voicelorn turned to the young noble well lieutenanthe nodded and clucked his horse into motionit was when the birds scattered from their path that the adjunct found herself envying the captain before her the roused carrioneaters exposed a carpet of armour broken bones and meat the air was hot turgid and cloying she saw soldiers still helmed their heads crushed by what must have been huge terribly powerful jaws she saw torn mail crumpled shields and limbs that had been ripped from bodies lorn managed only a few moments of careful examination of the scene around them before she fixed her gaze on the promontory ahead unable to encompass the magnitude of the slaughter her stallion bred of the finest lines of seven cities stock a warhorse trained in the blood for generations had lost its proud unyielding strut and now picked its way carefully along the roadlorn realized she needed a distraction and sought it in conversationlieutenant have you received your commission yetno adjunct i expect to be stationed in the capitalshe raised an eyebrow indeed and how will you manage that paran squinted ahead a tight smile on his lips it will be arrangedi see lorn fell silent the nobles have refrained from seeking military commissions kept their heads low for a long time havent theysince the first days of the empire the emperor held no love for us whereas empress laseens concerns seem to lie elsewherelorn eyed the young man i see you like taking risks lieutenant she said unless your presumption extends to goading the adjunct to the empress are you that confident of your bloods invincibilitysince when is speaking the truth presumptuousyou are young arent youthis seemed to sting paran a flush rose in his smoothshaven cheeksadjunct for the past seven hours i have been kneedeep in torn flesh and spilled blood ive been fighting crows and gulls for bodiesdo you know what these birds are doing here precisely theyre tearing off strips of meat and fighting over them theyre getting fat on eyeballs and tongues livers and hearts in their frantic greed they fling the meat around he paused visibly regaining control over himself as he straightened in his saddle im not young any more adjunct as for presumption i honestly couldnt care less truth cant be danced around not out here not now not ever againthey reached the far slope off to the left a narrow track led down towards the sea paran gestured to it then angled his horse forwardlorn followed her thoughtful expression holding on the lieutenants broad back before she turned her attention to the route they took the path was narrow skirting the promontorys bluff off to the left the trails edge dropped away to rocks sixty feet below the tide was out the waves breaking on a reef a few hundred yards offshore pools filled the black bedrocks cracks and basins dully reflecting an overcast skythey came to a bend and beyond and below stretched a crescent shaped beach above it at the promontorys foot lay a broad grassy shelf on which squatted a dozen hutsthe adjunct swung her gaze seaward the barques rested on their low flanks beside their mooring poles the air above the beach and the tidal flat was emptynot a bird in sightshe halted her mount a moment later paran glanced back at her then did the same he watched her as she removed her helmet and shook out her long auburn hair it was wet and stringy with sweat the lieutenant rode back to her side a questioning took in his eyeslieutenant paran your words were well spoken she breathed in the salty air then met his gaze you wont be stationed in unta im afraid you will be taking your orders from me as a commissioned officer on my staffhis eyes slowly narrowed what happened to those soldiers adjunctshe didnt answer immediately leaning back on her saddle and scanning the distant sea someones been here she said a sorcerer of great power somethings happened and were being diverted from discovering itparans mouth dropped open killing four hundred people was a diversionif that man and his daughter had been out fishing theyd have come in with the tidebutyou wont find their bodies lieutenantparan was puzzled now whatshe glanced at him then swung her horse around we go backthats it he stared after her as she directed her mount back up the trail then rode to catch up wait a minute adjunct he said as he came alongsideshe gave him a warning lookparan shook his head no if im now on your staff i have to know more about whats going onshe placed her helmet back on and cinched tight the strap under her chin her long hair dangled in tattered ropes down over her imperial cape very well as you know lieutenant im no mageno paran cut in with a cold grin you just hunt them down and kill themdont interrupt me again as i was saying i am anathema to sorcery that means lieutenant that even though im not a practitioner i have a relationship with magic of sorts we know each other if you will i know the patterns of sorcery and i know the patterns of the minds that use

names and their descriptions use the militia if the locals are recalcitrantthey wont be paran said the kanese are cooperative folkthey reached the top of the trail and stopped at the road below wagons rocked among the bodies the oxen braying and stamping their bloodsoaked hoofs soldiers shouted in the press while overhead wheeled thousands of birds the scene stank of panic at the far end stood the captain his helmet hanging from its strap in one handthe adjunct stared down on the scene with hard eyes for their sake she said i hope youre right lieutenantas he watched the two riders approach something told the captain that his days of ease in itko kan were numbered his helmet felt heavy in his hand he eyed paran that thinblooded bastard had it made a hundred strings pulling him every step of the way to some cushy posting in some peaceful cityhe saw lorn studying him as they came to the crest captain i have a request for youthe captain grunted request hell the empress has to check her slippers every morning to make sure this one isnt already in them of course adjunctthe woman dismounted as did paran the lieutenants expression was impassive was that arrogance or had the adjunct given him something to think aboutcaptain lorn began i understand theres a recruiting drive under way in kan do you pull in people from outside the cityto join sure more of them than anyone else city folk got too much to give up besides they get the bad news first most of the peasants dont know everythings gone to hell on genabackis a lot of them figure city folk whine too much anyway may i ask

captain thought and im the emperor reincarnated too bad he mutteredoh the adjunct faced him lieutenant paran is now on my staff i trust youll make the necessary adjustmentsas you wish adjunct i love paperworkthat earned him a slight smile then it was gone lieutenant paran will be leaving nowthe captain looked at the young noble and smiled letting the smile say everything working for the adjunct was like being the worm on the hook the adjunct was the hook and at the other end of the line was the empress let him squirma sour expression flitted across parans face yes adjuncthe climbed back into the saddle saluted then rode off down the roadthe captain watched him leave then said anything else adjunctyesher tone brought him aroundi would like to hear a soldiers opinion of the nobilitys present inroads on the imperial command structurethe captain stared hard at her it aint pretty adjunctgo onthe captain talkedit was the eighth day of recruiting and staff sergeant aragan sat blearyeyed behind his desk as yet another whelp was prodded forward by the corporal theyd had some luck here in kan fishings best in the backwaters kans fist had said all they get around here is stories stories dont make you bleed stories dont make you go hungry dont give you sore feet when youre young and smelling of pigshit and convinced there aint a weapon in all the damn world thats going to hurt you all stories do is make you want to be part of themthe old woman was right as usual these people had been under the boot so long they actually liked it well aragan thought the education begins hereit had been a bad day with the local captain roaring off with three companies and leaving not one solid rumour in their wake about what was going on and if that wasnt bad enough laseens adjunct arrived from unta not ten minutes later using one of those eerie magical warrens to get here though hed never seen her just her name on the hot dry wind was enough to give him the shakes mage killer the scorpion in the imperial pocketaragan scowled down at the writing tablet and waited until the corporal cleared his throat then he looked upthe recruit standing before him took the staff sergeant aback he opened his mouth on his tongue a lashing tirade designed to send the young ones scampering a second later he shut it again the words unspoken kans fist had made her instructions abundantly clear if they had two arms two legs and a head take them the genabackis campaign was a mess fresh bodies were neededhe grinned at the girl she matched the fists description perfectlystill all right lass you understand youre in line to join the malazan marines rightthe girl nodded her gaze steady and cool and fixed on araganthe recruiters expression tightened damn she cant be more than twelve or thirteen if this was my daughterwhats got her eyes looking so bloody old the last time hed seen anything like them had been outside mott forest on genabackished been marching through farmland hit by five years drought and a war twice as long those old eyes were brought by hunger or death he scowled whats your name girlam i in then she asked quietlyaragan nodded a sudden headache pounding against the inside of his skull youll get your assignment in a weeks time unless you got a preferencegenabackan campaign the girl answered immediately under the command of high fist dujek onearm onearms hostaragan blinked ill make a note he said softly your name soldiersorry my name is sorryaragan jotted the name down on his tablet dismissed soldier the corporal will tell you where to go he looked up as she was near the door and wash all that mud off your feet aragan continued writing for a moment then stopped it hadnt rained in weeks and the mud around here was halfway between green and grey not dark red he tossed down the stylus and massaged his temples well at least the headaches fadinggerrom was a league and a half inland along the old kan road a preempire thoroughfare rarely used since the imperial raised coast road had been constructed the traffic on it these days was mostly on foot local farmers and fishers with their goods of them only unravelled and torn bundles of clothing broken baskets and trampled vegetables littering the track remained to give evidence of their passage a lame mule the last sentinel overseeing the refuse of an exodus stood dumbly nearby ankledeep in a rice paddy it spared paran a single forlorn glance as he rode pastthe detritus looked to be no more than a day old the fruits and greenleaved vegetables only now beginning to rot in the afternoon heathis horse carrying him at a slow walk paran watched as the first outbuildings of the small trader town came into view through the dusty haze no one moved between the shabby mudbrick houses no dogs came out to challenge him and the only cart in sight leaned on a single wheel to add to the uncanny scene the air was still empty of birdsongparan loosened the sword in its scabbardas he neared the outbuildings he halted his mount the exodus had been swift a panicked flight yet he saw no bodies no signs of violence beyond the haste evident in those leaving he drew a deep breath slowly released it then clicked his horse forward the main street was in effect the towns only street leading at its far end to an intersection marked by a single twostorey stone building the imperial constabulary its tin backed shutters were closed its heavy banded door shut as he approached paran held his eyes on the buildinghe dismounted before it tying his mare to the hitching rail then looking back up the street no movement unsheathing his blade paran swung back to the constabulary doora soft steady sound from within stopped him too low to be heard from any distance but now as he stood before the huge door he could hear a liquid murmuring that raised the hairs on his neck paran reach out with his sword and set its point under the latch he lifted the handle upward until it disengaged then pushed open the doormovement rippled in the gloom within a flap and soft thumping air carrying to paran the redolent stench of putrifying flesh breathing hard and with a mouth dry as old cotton he waited for his eyes to adjusthe stared into the constabularys outer room and it was a mass movement a chilling soft sussuration of throats giving voice the chamber was filled with black pigeons cooing in icy calm uniform human shapes lay in their midst stretched haphazardly across the floor amid droppings and drifting black down sweat and death clung to the air thick as gauzehe took a step inside the pigeons rustled but otherwise ignored him none made for the open doorwayswollen faces with coindull eyes stared up from the shadows the faces were blue as of men suffocated paran looked down at one of the soldiers not a healthy thing he muttered wearing these uniforms these daysa conjuring of birds to keep mocking vigil dark humours not to liking any more i think he shook himself walked across the room the pigeons tracked away from his boots clucking the door to the captain office was ajar musty light bled through the shuttered windows uneven joins sheathing his sword paran entered the office the captain still sat in his chair his face bloated and bruised in shades of blue green and greyparan swept damp feathers from the desktop rummaged through the scroll work the papyrus sheets fell apart under his touch the leaves rotten and oily between his fingersa thorough eliminating of the trailhe turned away walked swiftly back through the outer room until he stepped into the warm light he closed the constabulary door as no doubt the villagers hadthe dark bloom of sorcery was a stain few cared to examine too closely it had a way of spreadingparan untethered his mare climbed into the saddle and rode from the abandoned town he did not look backthe sun sat heavy and bloated amid a smear of crimson cloud on the horizon paran fought to keep his eyes open it had been a long day a horrific day the land around him once familiar and safe had become something else a place stirred with the dark currents of sorcery he was not looking forward to a night camped in the openhis mount plodded onward head down as dusk slowly enveloped them pulled by the weary chains of his thoughts paran tried to make sense of what had happened since morningsnatched out from the shadow of that sourfaced laconic captain and the garrison at kan the lieutenant had seen his prospects begin a quick rise aide to the adjunct was an advancement in his career he could not have even imagined a week ago despite the profession he had chosen his father and his sisters were bound to be impressed perhaps even awed by his achievement like so many other nobleborn sons and daughters hed long since set his sights on the imperial military hungry for prestige and bored with the complacent static attitudes of the noble class in general paran wanted something more challenging than coordinating shipments of wine or overseeing the breeding of horsesnor was he among the first to enlist thus easing the way for entrance into officer training and selective postings it had just been illluck that saw him sent to kan where a veteran garrison had been licking its wounds for nigh on six years thered been little respect for an untested lieutenant and even less for a noblebornparan suspected that that had changed since the slaughter on the roadhed handled it better than many of those veterans helped in no small part by the superb breeding of his horse more to prove to them all his cool detached professionalism hed volunteered to lead the inspection detailhed done well although the detail had proved difficult hed heard screaming while crawling around among the bodies coming from somewhere inside his own head his eyes had fixed on details odditiesthe peculiar twist of this body the inexplicable smile on that dead soldiers facebut what had proved hardest was what had been done to the horses crusted foamfilled nostrils and mouthsthe signs of terrorand the wounds were terrible huge and devastating bile and faeces stained the onceproud mounts and over everything was a glittering carpet of blood and slivers of red flesh he had nearly wept for those horseshe shifted uneasily on the saddle feeling a clamminess come to his hands where they rested on the ornate horn hed held on to his confidence through the whole episode yet now as his thoughts returned to that horrid scene it was as if something that had always been solid in his mind now stuttered shied threatening his balance the faint contempt hed shown for those veterans in his troop kneeling helpless on the roadside racked by dryheaves returned to him now with a ghoulish castand the echo that came from the constabulary at gerrom arriving like a late blow to his already bruised and battered soul rose once again to pluck at the defensive numbness still holding him in checkparan straightened with an effort hed told the adjunct his youth was gone hed told her other things as well fearless uncaring lacking all the caution his father had instilled in him when it came to the many faces of the empirefrom a great distance in his mind came old old words live quietlyhed rejected that notion then he rejected it still the adjunct however had noticed him he wondered now for the first time if he was right to feel pride that hardbitten commander of so many years ago on the walls of mocks hold would have spat at parans feet with contempt had he now stood before him the boy was a boy no longer but a manshouldve heeded my words son now look at youhis mare pulled up suddenly hoofs thumping confusedly on the rutted road paran reached for his weapon as he looked uneasily around in the gloom the track ran through rice paddies the nearest shacks of the peasants on a parallel ridge a hundred paces from the road yet a figure now blocked the roada cold breath swirled lazily past pinning back the mares ears and widening her nostrils as she flinchedthe figurea man by his heightwas swathed in shades of green cloaked hooded wearing a faded tunic and linen leggings above greendyed leather boots a single longknife the weapon of choice among seven cities warriors was slung through a thin belt the mans hands faintly grey in the afternoon light glittered with rings rings on every finger above and below the knuckles he raised one now holding up a clay jugthirsty lieutenant the mans voice was soft the tone strangely melodichave i business with you paran asked his hand remaining on the grip of his longswordthe man smiled pulling back his hood his face was long the skin a lighter shade of grey the eyes dark and strangely angled he looked to be in his early thirties though his hair was white the adjunct asked of me a favour he said she grows impatient for your report i am to escort you with haste he shook the jug but first a repast i have a veritable feast secreted in my pocketsfar better fare than a browbeaten kanese village can offer join me here on the roadside we can amuse ourselves in conversation and idle watching of peasants toiling endlessly i am named topperi know that name paran saidwell you should topper replied i am he alas the blood of a tiste and races in my veins seeking escape no doubt from its more common human stream mine was the hand that took the life of untas royal line king queen sons and daughtersand cousins second cousins thirdexpunging all hope indeed such was my duty as a claw of unsurpassed skill but you have failed in answering my questionwhich wasthirstyscowling paran dismounted i thought you said the adjunct wished for hastehasten we shall lieutenant once weve filled our bellies and conversed in civil fashionyour reputation puts civility far down your list of skills clawits a most cherished trait of mine that sees far too little opportunity for exercise these fell days lieutenant surely youd grant me some of your precious time since im to be your escortwhatever arrangement you made with the adjunct is between you and her paran said approaching i owe you nothing topper except enmitythe claw squatted removing wrapped packages from his pockets followed by two crystal goblets he uncorked the jug ancient wounds i was led to understand youve taken a different path leaving behind the dull jostling ranks of the nobility he poured filling the goblets with ambercoloured wine you are now one with the body of empire lieutenant it commands you you respond unquestioningly to its wit you are a small part of a muscle in that body no more no less the time for old grudges is long past so he set down the jug and hande paran a goblet we now salute new beginnings ganoes paran lieutenant and aide to adjunct lornscowling paran accepted the gobletthe two dranktopper smiled producing a silk handkerchief to dab against his lip there now that wasnt so difficult was it may i call you by your chosen nameparan will do and you what title does the commander of the claw holdtopper smiled again laseen still commands the claw i assist her in this way i too am an aide of sorts you may call me by my chosen name of course im not one for maintaining formalities beyond a reasonable point in an acquaintanceparan sat down on the muddy road and weve passed that pointindeedhow do you decideah well topper began unwrapping his packages revealing cheese fistbread fruit and berries i make acquaintances in one of two ways youve seen the second of thoseand the firstno time for proper introductions in those instances alaswearily paran unstrapped and removed his helm do you wish to hear what i found in gerrom he asked running a hand through his black hairtopper shrugged if youve the needperhaps id better await my audience with the adjunctthe claw smiled you have begun to learn paran never be too easy with the knowledge you possess words are like coinit pays to hoarduntil you die on a bed of gold paran saidhungry i hate eating aloneparan accepted a chunk of fistbread so was the adjunct truly impatient or are you here for other reasonswith a smile the claw rose alas genteel conversation is done our way opens he faced the roadparan turned to see a curtain in the air tear open on the road spilling dull yellow light a warren the secret paths of sorcery hoods breathhe sighed fighting off a sudden chill within he could see a greyish pathway humped on either side by low mounded walls and vaulted overhead by impenetrable ochrehued mist the air swept past into the portal like a drawn breath revealing the pathway to be of ash as invisible currents stirred and raised spinning dustdevilsyou will have to get used to this topper saidparan collected his mares reins and slung his helm on the saddlehornlead on he saidthe claw cast him a quick appraising glance then strode into the warrenparan followed the portalway closed behind them in its place a continuation of the path itko kan had vanished and with it all signs of lifethe world they had entered was barren deathly the banked mounds lining the trail proved to be more ash the air was gritty tasting of metalwelcome to the imperial warren topper said with a hint of mockerypleasantcarved by force out of what was here before has such an effort ever been achieved before only the gods can saythey began walkingi take it then paran said that no god claims this warren by this you cheat the tolls the gatekeepers the guardians on unseen bridges and all the others said to dwell in the warrens in service to their immortal masterstopper grunted you imagine the warrens as crowded as that well the beliefs of the ignorant are ever entertaining you shall be good company on this short journey i thinkparan fell silent the horizons beyond the banked heaps of ash were close a vague blending of ochre sky and greyblack ground sweat trickled under his mail hauberk his mare snorted heavilyin case you were wondering topper said after a time the adjunct is now in unta we will use this warren to cross the distancethree hundred leagues in only a few short hours some think the empire has grown too large some even think their remote provinces are beyond the empress laseens reach as you have just learned paran such beliefs are held by foolsthe mare snorted againive shamed you into silence then i do apologize lieutenant for mocking your ignoranceits a risk youll have to live with paran saidthe next thousand paces of silence belonged to topperno shifting of light marked the passing of hours a number of times they came upon places where the ash embankments had been disturbed as by the passage of something large shambling and wide a slithery trail led off into the gloom in one such place they found a dark encrusted stain and the scatter of chain links like coins in the dust topper examined the scene closely while paran watchedhardly the secure road bed have me believe therere strangers here and theyre not friendlyhe was not surprised to find topper increasing their pace thereaftera short while later they came to a stone archway it had been recently constructed and paran recognized the basalt as untan from the imperial quarries outside the capital the walls of his familys estate were of the same greyblack glittering stone at the centre of the arch high over their heads was carved a taloned hand holding a crystal globe the mala imperial sigilbeyond the arch was darknessparan cleared his throat we have arrivedtopper spun to him you answer civility with arrogance lieutenant youd do well to shed the noble hauteursmiling paran gestured lead on escortin a whirl of cloak topper stepped through the arch and vanishedthe mare bucked as paran pulled her closer to the arch head tossinghe tried to soothe her but it was no use finally he climbed into the saddle and gathered up the reins he straightened the horse then drove hard his spurs into her flanks she bolted leaped into the voidlight and colours exploded outward engulfing them the mares hoofs landed with a crunching thump scattering something that might be gravel in all directions paran halted his horse blinking as he took in the scene around them a vast chamber its ceiling glittering with beaten gold its walls lined with tapestries and a score of armoured guards closing in on all sidesalarmed the mare sidestepped to send topper sprawling a hoof lashed out after him missing by a handspan more gravel crunchedonly it was not gravel paran saw but mosaic stones topper rolled to his feet with a curse his eyes flashing as he glared at the lieutenantthe guardsmen seemed to respond to some unspoken order slowly withdrawing to their positions along the walls paran swung his attention from topper before him was a raised dais surmounted by a throne of twisted bone in the throne sat the empresssilence fell in the chamber except for the crunch of semiprecious gems beneath the mares hoofs grimacing paran dismounted warily eyeing the woman seated on the thronelaseen had changed little since the only other time hed been this close to her plain and unadorned her hair short and fair above the blue tint of her unmemorable features her brown eyes regarded him narrowlyparan adjusted his swordbelt clasped his hands and bowed from the waist empressi see laseen drawled that you did not heed the commanders advice of seven years agohe blinked in surpriseshe continued of course he did not heed the advice given him either i wonder what god tossed you two together on that parapeti would do service to acknowledge its sense of humour did you imagine the imperial arch would exit in the stables lieutenantmy horse was reluctant to make the passage empresswith good reasonparan smiled unlike me shes of a breed known for its intelligence please accept my humblest apologiestopper will see you to the adjunct she gestured and a guardsman came forward to collect the mares reinsparan bowed again then faced the claw with a smiletopper led him to a side dooryou fool he snapped as the door was closed soundly behind themhe strode quickly down the narrow hallway paran made no effort to keep pace forcing the claw to wait at the far end where a set of stairs wound upward toppers expression was dark with fury what was that about a parapet youve met her beforewhensince she declined to explain i can only follow her example paran said he eyed the saddlebacked stairs this would be the west tower then the tower of dustto the top floor the adjunct awaits you in her chamberstheres no other doors so you wont get lost just keep on until you reach the topparan nodded and began climbingthe door to the towers top room was ajar paran rapped a knuckle against it and stepped inside the adjunct was seated at a bench at the far end her back to a wide window its shutters were thrown open revealing the red glint of sunrise she was getting dressed paran halted embarrassedim not one for modesty the adjunct said enter and close the door behind youparan did as he was bidden he looked around faded tapestries lined the walls ragged furs covered the stone tiles of the floor the furniturewhat little there waswas old napan in style and thus artlessthe adjunct rose to shrug into her leather armour her hair shimmered in the red light you look exhausted lieutenant please sithe looked around found a chair and slumped gratefully into it the trails been thoroughly obscured adjunct the only people left in gerrom arent likely to talkshe fastened the last of the clasps unless i were to send a necromancerhe grunted tales of pigeonsi think the possibility was foreseenshe regarded him with a raised browpardon adjunct it seems that deaths heralds were birdsand were we to glance through the eyes of the dead soldiers we would see little else pigeons you saidhe noddedcurious she fell silenthe watched her for a moment longer was i bait adjunctnohe fell silent when he closed his eyes his head spun hed not realized how weary hed become it was a moment before he understood that she was speaking to him he shook himself straightenedthe adjunct stood before him sleep later not now lieutenant i was informing you of your future it would be well if you paid attention you completed your task as instructed indeed you have proved yourself highly resilient to all outward appearances i am done with you lieutenant you will be returned to the officer corps here in unta what will follow will be a number of postings completing your official training as for your time in itko kan nothing unusual occurred there doand what of what really happened there adjunct do we abandon pursuit do we resign ourselves to never knowing exactly what happened or why or is it simply me who is to be abandonedlieutenant this is a trail we must not follow too closely but follow it we shall and you will be central to the effort i have assumedperhaps in errorthat you would wish to see it through to be witness when the time for vengeance finally arrives was i wrong perhaps youve seen enough and seek only a return to normalityhe closed his eyes adjunct i would be there when the time cameshe was silent and he knew without opening his eyes that she was studying him gauging his worth he was beyond unease and beyond caring hed stated his desire the decision was herswe proceed slowly your reassignment will take effect in a few days time in the meanwhile go home to your fathers estate get some resthe opened his eyes and rose to his feet as he reached the doorway she spoke again lieutenant i trust you wont repeat the scene in the halli doubt itd earn as many laughs the second time around adjunctas he reached the stairs he heard what might have been a cough from the room behind him it was hard to imagine that it could have been anyas he led his horse through the streets of unta he felt numb inside the familiar sights the teeming interminable crowds the voices and clash of languages all struck paran as something strange something altered not before his eyes but in that unknowable place between his eyes and his thoughts the change was his alone and it made him feel shorn outcast yet the place was the same the scenes before him were as they always had been and even in watching it pass by all around him nothing had changed it was the gift of noble blood that kept the world at a distance to be observed from a position unsullied unjostled by the commonrygift and cursenow however paran walked among them without the family guardsthe power of blood was gone and all he possessed by way of armour was the uniform he now wore not a craftsman not a hawker not a merchant but a soldier a weapon of the empire and the empire had those in the tens of thousandshe passed through toll ramp gate and made his way along marble slope road where the first merchant estates appeared pushed back from the cobbled street half hidden by courtyard walls the foliage of gardens joined their lively colours with brightly painted walls the crowds diminished and private guards were visible outside arching gatesthe sweltering air lost its reek of sewage and rotting food slipping cooler across unseen fountains and carrying into the avenue the fragrance of blossomssmells of childhoodthe estates spread out as he led his horse deeper into the noble district breathingspace purchased by history and ancient coin the empire seemed to melt away a distant mundane concern here families traced their lines back seven centuries to those tribal horsemen who had first come to this land from the east in blood and fire as was always the way they had conquered and subdued the cousins of the kanese whod built villages along this coast from warrior horsemen to horsebreeders to merchants of wine beer and cloth an ancient nobility of the blade now a nobility of hoarded gold trade agreements subtle manoeuvrings and hidden corruptions in gilded rooms and oillit corridorsparan had imagined himself acquiring trappings that closed a circle a return to the blade from which his family had emerged strong and savage all those centuries ago for his choice his father had condemned himhe came to a familiar postern a single high door along one side wall and facing an alley that in another part of the city would be a wide streetthere was no guard here just a thin bellchain which he pulled twicealone in the alley paran waiteda bar clanked on the other side a voice growled a curse as the door swung back on protesting hingesparan found himself staring down at an unfamiliar face the man was old scarred and wearing muchmended chainmail that ended raggedly around his knees his pothelm was uneven with hammeredout dents yet polished brightthe man eyed paran up and down with watery grey eyes then grunted the tapestry livesexcuse methe guardsman swung the door wide older now of course but its all the same by the lines good artist to capture the way of standing the expression and all welcome home ganoesparan led his horse through the narrow doorway the path between two outbuildings of the estate showing sky overheadi dont know you soldier paran said but it seems my portrait has been well studied by the guards is it now a throwrug in your barrackssomething like thatwhat is your namegamet the guard answered as he followed behind the horse after shutting and locking the door in service to your father these last three yearsand before that gametnot a question askedthey came to the courtyard paran paused to study the guardsman my fathers usually thorough in researching the histories of those enter gamet grinned revealing a full set of white teeth h that he did paran passed over the reins he swung about and looked round the courtyard it seemed smaller than he remembered the old well made by the nameless people whod lived here before even the kanese looked ready to crumble into a heap of dust no craftsman would reset those ancient carved stones fearing the curse of awakened ghosts under the estate house itself were similarly unmortared stones in the deepest reaches the many rooms and tunnels too bent twisted and uneven to servants and groundskeepers moved back and forth in the yard none gamet cleared his throat your father and mother arent herehe nodded thered be foals to care for at emalau the count your sisters are though gamet continued ill have the house servants freshen up your roomits been left as it was thengamet grinned again well clear out the extra furniture and casksas always paran sighed and without another word made his way to the house entrancethe feast hall echoed to parans boots as he strode to the long dining table cats bolted across the floor scattering at his approach he unclasped his travelling cloak tossed it across the back of a chair then sat at a longbench and leaned his back against the panelled wall he closed his eyesa few minutes passed then a womans voice spoke i thought you were in itko kanhe opened his eyes his sister tavore a year younger than him stood close to the head of the table one hand on the back of their fathers chairshe was as plain as ever a slash of bloodless lines comprising her features her reddish hair trimmed shorter than was the style she was taller than the last time hed seen her nearly his own height no longer the awkward child her expression revealed nothing as she studied himreassignment paran saidto here we would have heardah yes you would have wouldnt you all the sly whisperings among the connected familiesunplanned he conceded but done nevertheless not stationed here in unta though my visit is only a few dayshave you been promotedhe smiled is the investment about to reap coin reluctant as it was we still must think in terms of potential influence mustnt wemanaging this familys position is no longer your responsibility brotherah its yours now then has father withdrawn from the daily choresslowly his health is failing had you asked even in itko kan he sighed still making up for me tavore assuming the burden of my failings i hardly left here on a carpet of petals you may recall in any case i always assumed the house affairs would fall into capable hands her pale eyes narrowed but pride silenced the obvious question at her studies shes not heard of your return she will be very excited his sister snorted turning away telisin shes too soft for this world brother for any world i think shes not changed shell be happy to see you he watched her stiff back as she left the hallhe smelled of sweathis own and the marestravel and grime and of something else as well old blood and old fear paran looked around much

fallen city of pale tattersail stood alone scattered around the sorceress the curled remains of burnt armourgreaves breastplates helms and weaponslay heaped in piles an hour earlier there had been men and women wearing that armour but of them there was no sign the silence within those empty shells rang like a dirge in tattersails headher arms were crossed tight against her chest the burgundy cloak with its silver emblem betokening her command of the nd armys wizard cadre now hung from her round shoulders stained and scorchedher oval fleshy face usually parading an expression of cherubic humour was etched with deepshadowed lines leaving her cheeks flaccid and palefor all the smells and sounds surrounding tattersail she found herself listening to a deeper silence in some ways it came from the empty armour surrounding her an absence that was in itself an accusation but there was another source of the silence the sorcery that had been unleashed here today had been enough to fray the fabric between the worlds whatever dwelt beyond in the warrens of chaos felt close enough to reach out and touchshed thought her emotions spent used up by the terror she had just been through but as she watched the tight ranks of a legion of moranth black marching into the city a frost of hatred slipped over her heavylidded eyesallies theyre claiming their hour of blood at the end of that hour there

fixed on her intent in the way a dying person achieves in those last moments thought youd take a wave through the gut huh well i suppose thats one way to get shipped out of herehis reply surprised her the tough faade ill fits you sail always has he frowned and blinked rapidly fighting off darkness she supposed theres always the risk of knowing too much be glad i spared you he smiled unveiling redstained teeth think nice thoughts the flesh fadesshe eyed him steadily wondering at his sudden humanity maybe dying did away with the usual games the pretences of the living dancemaybe she just wasnt prepared to see the mortal man in hairlock finally showing itself tattersail prised her arms from the dreadful aching hug she had wrapped around herself and sighed shakily youre right its not the time for facades is it i never liked you hairlock but id never question your couragei never will she studied him critically a part of her astonished that the horror of his wound didnt so much as make her flinch i dont think even tayschrenns arts are enough to save you hairlocksomething cunning flashed in his eyes and he barked a pained laughdear girl he gasped your naivete never fails to charm meof course she snapped stung at falling for his sudden ingenuousness one last joke on me just for old times sakeyou misunderstandare you so certain youre saying it isnt over yet your hatred of our high mage is fierce enough to let you slip hoods cold grasp is that it vengeance from beyond the graveyou must know me by now i always arrange a back dooryou cant even crawl how do you plan on getting to itthe wizard licked his cracked lips part of the deal he said softly the door comes to me comes even as we speakunease coiled around her insides behind her tattersail heard the crunch of armour and the rattle of iron the sound arriving like a cold wind she turned to see the four soldiers appear on the summit three men one woman mudsmeared and crimsonstreaked their faces almost bonewhite the sorceress found her eyes drawn to the woman who hung back like an unwelcome afterthought as the three men approachedthe girl was young pretty as an icicle and looking as warm to the touchsomething wrong there carefulthe man in the leada sergeant by the torque on his armcame up to tattersail set deep in a lined exhausted face his dark grey eyes searched hers dispassionately this one he asked turning to the tall thin blackskinned man who came up beside himthis man shook his head no the one we want is over there he saidthough he spoke malazan his harsh accent was seven citiesthe third and last man also black slipped past on the sergeants left and for all his girth seemed to glide forward his eyes on hairlock his ignoring tattersail made her feel somehow slighted she considered a wellchosen word or two as he stepped around her but the effort seemed suddenly too muchwell she said to the sergeant if youre the burial detail youre early hes not dead yet of course she continued youre not the burial detail i know that hairlocks made some kind of dealhes thinking he can survive with half a bodythe sergeants lips grew taut beneath his grizzled wiry beard whats your point sorceressthe black man beside the sergeant glanced back at the young girl still standing a dozen paces behind them he seemed to shiver but his lean face was expressionless as he turned back and offered tattersail an enigmatic shrug before moving past hershe shuddered involuntarily as power buffeted her senses she drew a sharp breath hes a mage tattersail tracked the man as he joined his comrade at hairlocks side striving to see through the muck and blood covering his uniform who are you peopleninth squad the secondninth the breath hissed from her teeth youre bridgeburners her eyes narrowed on the battered sergeant the ninth that makes you whiskeyjackhe seemed to flinchtattersail found her mouth dry she cleared her throat ive heard of you of course ive heard thedoesnt matter he interrupted his voice grating old stories grow like weedsshe rubbed at her face feeling grime gather under her nailsbridgeburners theyd been the old emperors elite his favourites but since laseens bloody coup nine years ago theyd been pushed hard into every rats nest in sight almost a decade of this had cut them down to a single undermanned division among them names had emerged the survivors mostly squad sergeants names that pushed their way into the malazan armies on genabackis and beyond names spicing the already sweeping legend of onearms host detoran antsy spindle whiskeyjack names heavy with glory and bitter with the cynicism that every army feeds on they carried with them like an emblazoned standard the madness of this unending campaignsergeant whiskeyjack was studying the wreckage on the hill tattersail watched him piece together what had happened a muscle in his cheek twitched he looked at her with new understanding a hint of softening behind his grey eyes that almost broke tattersail then and there are you the last left in the cadre he askedshe looked away feeling brittle the last left standing it wasnt skill either just luckyif he heard her bitterness he gave no sign falling silent as he watched his two seven cities soldiers crouching low over hairlocktattersail licked her lips shifted uneasily she glanced over to the two soldiers a quiet conversation was under way she heard hairlock laugh the sound a soft jolt that made her wince the tall one she said hes a mage isnt hewhiskeyjack grunted then said his names quick bennot the one he was born withnoshe rolled her shoulders against the weight of her cloak momentarily easing the dull pain in her lower back i should know him sergeant that kind of power gets noticed hes no noviceno whiskeylack replied he isntshe felt herself getting angry i want an explanation whats happening herewhiskeyjack grimaced not much by the looks of it he raised his voice quick benthe mage looked over some lastminute negotiations sergeant he said flashing a white grinhoods breath tattersail sighed turning away the girl she saw still stood at the hills crest and seemed to be studying the moranth columns passing into the city as if sensing tattersails attention her head snapped around her expression startled the sorceress tattersail pulled her eyes away is this whats left of your squad sergeant two desert marauders and a bloodhungry recruitwhiskeyjacks tone was flat i have seven leftthis morningfifteensomethings wrong here feeling a need to say something she said better than most she cursed silently as the blood drained from the sergeants face still she added im sure they were good men the ones you lostgood at dying he saidthe brutality of his words shocked her mentally reeling she squeezed shut her eyes fighting back tears of bewilderment and frustration too much has happened im not ready for this im not ready for whiskeyjack a man buckling under his own legend a man whos climbed more than one mountain of the dead in service to the empirethe bridgeburners hadnt shown themselves much over the past three years since the siege began theyd been assigned the task of undermining pales massive ancient walls that order had come straight from the capital and it was either a cruel joke or the product of appalling ignorance the whole valley was a glacial dump a rock pile plugging a crevice that reached so far underground even tattersails mages had trouble finding its bottom theyve been underground three years running when was the last time they saw the suntattersail stiffened suddenly sergeant she opened her eyes to himyouve been in your tunnels since this morningwith sinking understanding she watched anguish flit across the mans face what tunnels he said softly then moved to stride past hershe reached out and closed her hand on his arm a shock seemed to run through him whiskeyjack she whispered youve guessed as much aboutabout me about what happened here on this hill all these soldiers she hesitated then said failures something we share im sorryhe pulled away eyes averted dont be sorceress he met her gaze regrets not something we can affordshe watched him walk to his soldiersa young womans voice spoke directly behind tattersail we numbered fourteen hundred this morning sorceresstattersail turned at this close range she saw that the girl couldnt be more than fifteen years old the exception was her eyes which held the dull glint of weathered onyxthey looked ancient every emotion eroded away into extinction and nowthe girls shrug was almost careless thirty maybe thirtyfive four of the five tunnels fell in completely we were in the fifth and dug our way out fiddler and hedge are working on the others but they figure everybody elses been buried for good they tried to round up some help a cold knowing smile spread across her mudstreaked face but your master the high mage stopped themtayschrenn did what whythe girl frowned as if disappointed then she simply walked away stopping at the hills crest and facing the city againtattersail stared after her the girl had thrown that last statement at her as if hunting for some particular response complicity in any case a clean miss tayschrenns not making any friends good the day had been a disaster and the blame fell squarely at the high mages feet she stared at pale then lifted her gaze to the smokefilled sky above itthat massive looming shape she had greeted every morning for the last three years was indeed gone she still had trouble believing it despite the evidence of her eyes you warned us she whispered to the empty sky as the memories of the morning returned you warned us didnt youshed been sleeping with calot the past four months a little diversionary pleasure to ease the boredom of a siege that wasnt going anywhere at least that was how she explained to herself their unprofessional conductit was more than that of course much more but being honest with herself had never been one of tattersails strengthsthe magical summons when it came awakened her before calot the mages small but wellproportioned body was snug in the many soft pillows of her flesh she opened her eyes to find him clinging to her like a child then he too sensed the calling and awoke to her smilehairlock he asked shivering as he climbed out from under the blanketstattersail grimaced who else the man never sleepswhat now i wonder he stood looking around for his tunicshe was watching him he was so thin making them an odd combination through the faint dawn light seeping through the canvas tent walls the sharp bony angles of his body looked soft almost childlikefor a man a century old he carried it well hairlocks been running errands for dujek she said its probably just an updatecalot grunted as he pulled on his boots thats what you get for taking command of the cadre sail anyway it was easier saluting nedurian let me tell you whenever i look at you i just want tostick to business calot tattersail said meaning it with humour though it came out with enough of an edge to make calot glance at her sharplysomething up he asked quietly the old frown finding its familiar lines on his high foreheadthought id got rid of those tattersail sighed cant tell except that hairlocks contacted both of us if it was just a report youd still be in growing tension they finished dressing in silence less than an hour later calot would be incinerated beneath a wave of blue fire and ravens would be answering tattersails despairing scream but for the moment the two mages were readying themselves for an unscheduled gathering at high fist dujek onearms command tentin the muddy path beyond calots tent soldiers of the last watch huddled around braziers filled with burning horse dung holding out hands to the heat few walked the pathways the hour still too earlyrow upon row of grey tents climbed the hills overlooking the plain that surrounded the city of pale regimental standards ruffled sullenly in a faint breezethe wind had turned since last night carrying to tattersail the stench of the latrine trenches overhead the remaining handful of stars dimmed into insignificance in the lightening sky the world seemed almost peacefuldrawing her cloak against the chill tattersail paused outside the tent and turned to study the enormous mountain hanging suspended a quartermile above the city of pale she scanned the battered face of moons spawnits name for as long as she could remember ragged as a blackened tooth the basalt fortress was home to the most powerful enemy the malazan empire had ever faced high above the earth moons spawn could not be breached by siege even laseens own undead army the tlan imass who travelled as easily as dust on the wind were unable or unwilling to penetrate its magical defencespales wizards had found a powerful ally tattersail recalled that the empire had locked horns with the moons mysterious lord once before in the days of the emperor things had threatened to get ugly but then moons spawn withdrew from the game no one still living knew whyjust one of the thousand secrets the emperor took with him to his watery gravethe moons reappearance here on genabackis had been a surpriseand this time there was no lastminute reprieve a halfdozen legions of the sorcerous tiste and descended from moons spawn and under the command of a warlord named caladan brood they joined forces with the crimson guard mercenaries together the two armies proceeded to drive back the malaz th army which had been pushing eastward along the northern edge of rhivi plain for the past four years the battered th had been bogged down in blackdog forest forcing them to make a stand against brood and the crimson guard it was a stand fast becoming a death sentencebut clearly caladan brood and the tiste and werent the only inhabitants of moons spawn an unseen lord remained in command of the fortress bringing it here and sealing a pact with pales formidable wizardstattersails cadre had little hope of magically challenging such opposition so the siege had ground to a halt with the exception of the bridgeburners who never relaxed their stubborn efforts to undermine the citys ancient wallsstay she prayed to moons spawn turn your face endlessly and keep the smell of blood the screams of the dying from settling on this landwait for us to blink firstcalot waited beside her he said nothing understanding the ritual this had become it was one of the many reasons why tattersail loved the man as a friend of course nothing serious nothing frightening in the love for a friendi sense impatience in hairlock calot murmured beside hershe sighed i do too thats why im reluctanti know but we cant dally too long sail he grinned mischievously bad formhmmm cant have them jumping to conclusions can wethey wouldnt have to jump very far anyway his smile faltered slightly lets get goinga few minutes later they arrived at the command tent the lone marine standing guard at the flap seemed nervous as he saluted the two mages tattersail paused and searched his eyes seventh regimentavoiding her gaze the guard nodded yes sorceress third squadthought you looked familiar give my regards to sergeant rusty she stepped closer something in the air soldierhe blinked high in the air sorceress high as they cometattersail glanced at calot who had paused at the tent flap calot puffed out his cheeks making a comical face thought i smelled himshe winced at this confirmation the guard she saw was sweating under his iron helmet thanks for the warning soldieralways an even trade sorceress the man snapped a second salute this one sharper and in its way more personal years and years of thisinsisting im family to them one of the nd armythe oldest intact force one of the emperors own always an even trade sorceress save our skins well save yours family after all why then do i always feel so estranged from them tattersail returned the salutethey entered the command tent she sensed immediately the presence of power what calot called smell it made his eyes water it gave her a migraine headache this particular emanation was a power she knew well and it was anathema to her own which made the headaches all the worseinside the tent lanterns cast a dim smoky light on the dozen or so wooden chairs in the first compartment a camptable off to one side held a tin pitcher of watered wine and six tarnished cups that glistened with droplets of condensationcalot muttered beside her hoods breath sail i hate thisas her eyes adjusted to the gloom tattersail saw through the opening that led into the tents second compartment a familiar robed figure he leaned with longfingered hands on dujeks maptable his magenta cloak rippled like water though he remained motionless oh really now tattersail whisperedjust my thought calot said wiping his eyesdo you think she said as they took their seats its a studied posecalot grinned absolutely laseens high mage couldnt read a battle map if his life depended on itso long as our lives dont depend on ita voice spoke from a chair near them today we worktattersail scowled at the preternatural darkness enwreathing the chairyoure as bad as tayschrenn hairlock and be glad i didnt decide to sit in that chairdully a row of yellow teeth appeared then the rest of the mage took shape as hairlock relinquished the spell beads of sweat marked the mans flat scarred brow and shaved patenothing unusual therehairlock would sweat in an icepit he held his head at an angle achieving in his expression something like smug detachment combined with contempt he fixed his small dark eyes on tattersail you remember work dont you his smile broadened further flattening his mashed misaligned nose its what you were doing before you started rolling in the sack with dear calot here before you went softtattersail drew breath for a retort but was interrupted by calots slow easy drawl lonely hairlock should i tell you that the campfollowers demand double the coin from you he waved a hand as if clearing away unsavoury thoughts the simple fact is dujek chose tattersail to command the cadre after nedurians untimely demise at mott wood you may not like it but thats just too bad its the price you pay for ambivalencehairlock reached down and brushed a speck of dirt from his satin slippers which had improbably escaped unmarred the muddy streets outside blind faith dear comrades is for foolshe was interrupted by the tent flap swishing aside high fist dujek onearm entered the soap of his morning shave still clotting the hair in his ears the smell of cinnamon water wafting after himover the years tattersail had come to attach much to that aromasecurity stability sanity dujek onearm represented all those things and not just to her but to the army that fought for him as he stopped now in the centre of the room and surveyed the three mages she leaned back slightly and from under heavy lids studied the high fist three years of enforced passivity in this siege seemed to have acted like a tonic on the ageing man he looked more like fifty rather than his seventynine years his grey eyes remained sharp and unyielding in his tanned lean face he stood straight which made him seem taller than his five and a half feet wearing simple unadorned leathers stained as much by sweat as by the imperial magenta dye the stump of his left arm just below the shoulder was wrapped in leather strips his hairy chalkwhite calves were visible between the sharkskin straps of the napan sandalscalot withdrew a handkerchief from his sleeve and tossed it to dujekthe high mage snagged it again damn that barber he growled wiping the soap from his jaw and ears i swear he does it on purposehe balled the handkerchief and flung it on to calots lap now were all here good regular business first hairlock you finished jawing with the boys belowhairlock stifled a yawn some sapper named fiddler took me in showed me around he paused to pluck lint from his brocaded sleeve then met dujeks eyes give them six or seven years and they might have reached the city walls by thenits pointless tattersail said which is what i put in my report she squinted up at dujek assuming it ever made it to the imperial courtcamels still swimming calot saiddujek gruntedas close as he ever got to laughing all right cadre listen carefully two things a faint scowl crossed his scarred featuresone the empress has sent a claw theyre in the city hunting down pales wizardsa chill danced up tattersails spine no one liked having the claws around those imperial assassinslaseens favoured weaponkept their poisoned daggers sharp for anyone and everyone malazans includedit seemed calot was thinking the same thing for he sat up sharply if theyre here for any other reasontheyll have to come through me first dujek said his lone hand reaching down to rest on the pommel of his longswordhe has an audience there in the other room hes telling the man commanding the claw how things stand shedunul bless himhairlock spoke theyll go to ground theyre wizards not idiotsit was a moment before tattersail understood the mans comment oh right pales wizardsdujek glanced down at hairlock gauging then he nodded two were attacking moons spawn todayin the other compartment high mage tayschrenn turned at these words and approached slowly within his hood a broad smile creased his dark face a momentary cracking of seamless features the smile passed quickly the ageless skin becoming smooth once again hello my colleagues he said droll and menacing all at oncehairlock snorted keep the melodrama to a minimum tayschrenn and well all be happierignoring hairlocks comment the high mage continued the empress has lost her patience with moons spawndujek cocked his head and interrupted his voice softly grating the empress is scared enough to hit first and hit hard tell it plain magicker this is your front line youre talking to here show some respect dammitthe high mage shrugged of course high fist he faced the cadreyour group myself and three other high mages will strike moons spawn within the hour the north campaign has drawn most of the edifices inhabitants away we believe that the moons lord is alone for almost three years his mere presence has been enough to hold us in check this morning my colleagues we will test this lords mettleand hope to hell hes been bluffing all this time dujek added a scowl deepening the lines on his forehead any questionshow soon can i get a transfer calot askedtattersail cleared her throat what do we know about the lord of moons spawnscant little im afraid tayschrenn said his eyes veiled a tiste and for certain an archmagehairlock leaned forward and deliberately spat at the floor in front of tayschrenn tiste and high mage i think we can be a little more specific than that dont youtattersails migraine worsened she realized she was holding her breath slowly forced it out as she gauged tayschrenns reactionto the mans words and to the traditional seven cities challengean archmage tayschrenn repeated perhaps the archmage of the tiste and dear hairlock he added his voice lowering a notch your primitive tribal gestures remain quaint if somewhat tastelesshairlock bared his teeth the tiste and are mother darks first children youve felt the tremors through the warrens of sorcery tayschrenn so have i ask dujek about the reports coming down from the north campaign elder magickurald galain the lord of moons spawn is the master archmageyou know his name as well as i doi know nothing of the sort the high mage snapped losing his calm at last perhaps youd care to enlighten us hairlock and then i can begin inquiries as to your sourcesahh hairlock bolted forward in his chair an eager malice in his taut face a threat from the high mage now were getting somewhere answer me this then why only three other high mages weve hardly been thinned out that badly more why didnt we do this two years agowhatever was building between hairlock and tayschrenn was interrupted by dujek who growled wordlessly then said were desperate mage the north campaign has gone sour the fifth is damn near gone and wont be getting any reinforcements until next spring the point is the moons lord could have his army back any day now i dont want to have to send you up against an army of tiste and and i sure as hell dont want the second having to show two fronts with a relieving force coming down on them bad tactics and whoever this caladan brood is hes shown himself adept at making us pay for our mistakescaladan brood calot murmured i swear ive heard that name somewhere before odd that ive never given it much thoughttattersails eyes narrowed on tayschrenn calot was right the name of the man commanding the tiste and alongside the crimson guard did sound familiarbut in an old way echoing ancient legends perhaps or some epic poemthe high mage met her gaze flat andcalculating the need he said turning to the others for justifications has passed the empress has commanded and we must obeyhairlock snorted a second time speaking of twisting arms he sat back still smiling contemptuously at tayschrenn remember how we played cat and mouse at aren this plan has your stink on it youve been itching for a chance like this for a long time his grin turned savage who then are the other three high mages let me guessenough tayschrenn stepped close to hairlock who went very still eyes glitteringthe lanterns had dimmed calot used the handkerchief in his lap to wipe tears from his cheekspower oh damn my bead feels ready to crack wide openvery well hairlock whispered lets lay it out on the table im sure the high fist will appreciate you putting all his suspicions in the proper order make it plain old friendtattersail glanced at dujek the commanders face had closed up his sharp eyes narrow and fixed on tayschrenn he was doing some hard thinkingcalot leaned against her what the hells going on sailno idea she whispered but its heating up nicely though shed made her comment light her mind was whirling around a cold knot of fear hairlock had been with the empire longer than she hador calothed been among the sorcerers whod fought against the malazans in seven cities before aren fell and the holy falahd were scattered before hed been given the choice of death or service to the new masters hed joined the nds cadre at panpotsunlike dujek himself hed been there with the emperors old guard when the first vipers of usurpation had stirred the day the empires first sword was betrayed and brutally murdered hairlock knew something but whatall right dujek drawled weve got work to do lets get at ittattersail sighed old onearms way with words she swung a look on the man she knew him well not as a frienddujek didnt make friendsbut as the best military mind left in the empire if as hairlock had just implied the high fist was being betrayed by someone somewhere and if tayschrenn was part of it were a bent bough calot had once said of onearms host and beware the empire when it breaks seven cities soldiery the closeted gbosts of the conquered but unconquerabletayschrenn gestured to her and to the other mages tattersail rose as did calot hairlock remained seated eyes closed as if asleepcalot said to dujek about that transferlater the high fist grunted paperworks a nightmare when youve only got one arm he surveyed his cadre and was about to add something but calot spoke firstanomandarishairlocks eyes snapped open found tayschrenn with bright pleasureahhh he said into the silence following calots single pronouncementof course three more high mages only threetattersail stared at dujeks pale still face the poem she said quietly i remember now caladan brood the menhired one winterbearing barrowed and sorrowlesscalot picked up the next lines in a tomb bereaved of words and in his hands that have crushed anvilstattersail continued  the hammer of his songhe lives asleep so give silent warning to allwake him notwake him noteveryone in the compartment was staring at tattersail now as her last words fell away hes awake it seems she said her mouth dryanomandaris the epic poem by fisher keltaththe poems not about caladan brood dujek said frowningno she agreed its mostly about his companionhairlock climbed slowly to his feet he stepped close to tayschrennanomander rake lord of the tiste and who are the souls of starless night rake the mane of chaos thats who the moons lord is and youre pitting four high mages and a single cadre against himtayschrenns smooth face held the faintest sheen of sweat now the tiste and he said in an even voice are not like us to you they may seem unpredictable but they arent just different they have no cause of their own they simply move from one human drama to the next do you actually think anomander rake will stay and fighthas caladan brood backed away hairlock snappedhe is not tiste and hairlock hes humansome say with barghast blood but none the less he shares nothing of elder blood or its waystattersail said youre counting on rake betraying pales wizardsbetraying the pact made between themthe risk is not as overreaching as it may seem the high mage said bellurdan has done the research in genabaris sorceress some new scrolls of gothos folly were discovered in a mountain fastness beyond blackdog forest among the writings are discussions of the tiste and and other peoples from the elder age and remember moons spawn has retreated from a direct confrontation with the empire beforethe waves of fear sweeping through tattersail made her knees weakshe sat down again heavily enough to make the camp chair creakyouve condemned us to death she said if your gamble proves wrong not just us high mage all of onearms hosttayschrernn swung round slowly putting his back to hairlock and the others empress laseens orders he said without turning our colleagues come by warren when they arrive i will detail the positioning that is all he strode into the map room resumed his original stancedujek seemed to have aged in front of tattersails eyes swiftly she slid her glance from him too anguished to meet the abandonment in his eyes and the suspicion curdling beneath its surface cowardthats what you are woman a cowardfinally the high fist cleared his throat prepare your warrens cadre as usual always an even tradegive the high mage credit tattersail thought there was tayschrenn standing on the first hill almost inside the moons shadow they had arrayed themselves into three groups each taking a hilltop on the plain outside pales walls the cadres was most distant tayschrenns the closest on the centre hill stood the three other high mages tattersail knew them all nightchill ravenhaired tall imperious and with a cruel streak the old emperor used to drool over at her side her lifelong companion bellurdan skullcrusher a thelomen giant who would test his prodigious strength against the moons portal should it come to thatand nkaronys firewielder short and round his burning staff taller than a spearthe nd and th armies had formed ranks on the plain weapons bared and awaiting the call to march on the city when the time cameseven thousand veterans and four thousand recruits the black moranth legions lined the ridge to the west a quartermile distantno wind stirred the midday air biting midges roved in visible clouds through the soldiers waiting below the sky was overcast the cloud cover thin but absolutetattersail stood on the hills crest sweat running down under her clothing and watched the soldiers on the plain before facing her meagre cadre at full strength six mages should have been arrayed behind her but there were only two off to one side hairlock waited wrapped in the dark grey raincloak that was his battle attirelooking smugcalot nudged tattersail and jerked his head towards hairlock whats he so happy abouthairlock tattersail called the man swung his head were you right about the three high mageshe smiled then turned away againi hate it when hes hiding something calot saidthe sorceress grunted hes added something up all right whats so particular about nightchill bellurdan and nkaronys why did tayschrenn pick them and how did hairlock know hed pick themquestions questions calot sighed all three are old hands at this kind of stuff back in the days of the emperor they each commanded a company of adeptswhen the empire had enough mages in the ranks to form actual companies nkaronys climbed through the ranks in the falari campaign and bellurdan and nightchill were from before even thencame down from fenn on the quon mainland during the unification warsall old hands tattersail mused as you said none have been active lately have they their last campaign was seven citieswhere nkaronys took a beating in the panpotsun wasteshe was left hangingthe emperor had just been assassinated everything was chaotic the tlan imass refused to acknowledge the new empress marched themselves off into the jhag odhanrumour has it theyre back at halfstrengthwhatever they ran into out there wasnt pleasanttattersail nodded nightchill and bellurdan were told to report to nathilog left sitting on their hands for the past six seven yearsuntil tayschrenn sent the thelomen off to genabaris to study a pile of ancient scrolls of all thingsim frightened tattersail admitted very frightened did you see dujeks face he knew somethinga realization and it hit him like a dagger in the backtime to work hairlock calledcalot and tattersail swung arounda shiver ran through her moons spawn had been revolving steadily for the last three years it had just stopped near its very top on the side facing them was a small ledge and a shadowed recess had appeared a portal no movement showed yet he knows she whisperedand he isnt running calot addeddown on the first hill high mage tayschrenn rose and lifted his arms out to the sides a wave of golden flame spanned his hands then rolled upward growing as it raced towards moons spawn the spell crashed against the black rock sending chunks hurtling out then down a rain of death descended into the city of pale and among the malazan legions waiting in the plainits begun calot breathedsilence answered tayschrenns first attack save for the faint scatter of rubble on the citys tiled rooftops and the distant cries of wounded soldiers on the plain everyones eyes were trained upwardthe reply was not what anyone expecteda black cloud enshrouded moons spawn followed by faint shriekinga moment later the cloud spread out fragmenting and tattersail realized what she was seeingravensthousands upon thousands of great ravens they must have nested among the crags and pocks in the moons surface their shrieks grew more defined a caterwaul of outrage they wheeled out from the moon their fifteenfoot wingspans catching the wind and lifting them high above the city and plainfear lurched into terror in tattersails hearthairlock barked a laugh and whirled to them these are the moons messengers colleagues madness glittered in his eyes these carrion birds he flung back his cloak and raised his arms imagine a lord whos kept thirty thousand great ravens well feda figure had appeared on the ledge before the portal its arms upraised long silver hair blowing from its headmane of chaos anomander rake lord of the blackskinned tiste and who has looked down on a hundred thousand winters who has tasted the blood of dragons who leads the last of his kind seated in the throne of sorrow and a kingdom tragic and feya kingdom with no land to call its ownanomander rake looked tiny against the backdrop of his edifice almost insubstantial at this distance the illusion was about to be shattered she gasped as the aura of his power bloomed outwardto see it at such a distance channel your warrens tattersail commanded her voice cracking noweven as rake gathered his power twin balls of blue fire raced upward from the centre hill they struck the moon near its base and rocked ittayschrenn launched another wave of gilden flames crashing with amber spume and redtongued smokethe moons lord responded a black writhing wave rolled down to the first hill the high mage was buffeted to his knees deflecting it the hilltop around him blighted as the necrous power rolled down the slopes engulfing nearby ranks of soldiers tattersail watched as a midnight flash swallowed the hapless men followed by a thump that thundered through the earth when the flash dissipated the soldiers lay in rotting heaps mown down like stalks of grainkurald galain sorcery elder magic the breath of chaosher breaths coming fast and tight in her chest tattersail felt her thyr warren flow into her she shaped it muttering chainwords under her breath then unleashed the power calot followed drawing from his mockra warren hairlock surrounded himself in his own mysterious source and the cadre entered the frayeverything narrowed down for tattersail from then on yet a part of her mind remained distant held on a leash of terror observing with a kind of muffled vision all that happened around herthe world became a living nightmare as sorcery flew upward to batter moons spawn and sorcery rained downward indiscriminate and devastating earth rose skyward in thundering columns rocks ripped through men like hot stones through snow a downpour of ash descended to cover the living and dead alike the sky dimmed to pallid rose the sun a coppery disc behind the hazeshe saw a wave sweep past hairlocks defences cutting him in halfhis howl was more rage than pain instantly muted as virulent power washed over tattersail and she found her own defences assailed by the sorcerys cold screaming will as it sought to destroy her she reeled back brought up short by calot as he added his mockra power to bolster her faltering parries then the assault passed sweeping on and down the hill to their lefttattersail had fallen to her knees calot stood over her chaining words of power around her his face turned away from moons spawn fixed on something or someone down below on the plain his eyes were wide with terrortoo late tattersail understood what was happening calot was defending her at his own expense a final act even as he watched his own death erupt around him a blast of bright fire engulfed him abruptly the net of protection over tattersail vanished a wash of crackling heat from where calot had stood sent her tumbling to one side she felt more than heard her own shriek and her sense of distance closed in then a layer of mental defence obliteratedspitting dirt and ashes tattersail climbed to her feet and fought on no longer launching attacks just struggling to remain alive somewhere in the back of her head a voice was screaming urgent panicked calot had faced the plain not moons spawnhed faced right hairlock had been struck from the plainshe watched as a kenryllah demon arose beneath nightchilllaughing shrilly the towering gaunt creature tore nightchill limb from limb it had begun feeding by the time bellurdan arrived the thelomen bellowed as the demon raked its knifelike talons against his chestignoring the wounds and the blood that sprayed from them he closed his hands around the demons head and crushed itnkaronys unleashed gouts of flame from the staff in his hands until moons spawn almost disappeared inside a ball of fire then ethereal wings of ice closed around the short fat wizard freezing him where he stood an instant later he was crushed to dustmagic rained in an endless storm around tayschrenn where he still knelt on the withered blackened hilltop but every wave directed his way he shunted aside wreaking devastation among the soldiers cowering on the plain through the carnage filling the air through the ash and shrill tongued ravens through the raining rocks and the screams of the wounded and dying through the bloodchilling shrieks of demons flinging themselves into ranks of soldierythrough it all sounded the steady thunder of the high mages onslaught enormous cliffs sheared from the moons face and raging with flame and trailing columns of black smoke fell down into the city of pale transforming the city into its own cauldron of death and chaosher ears numbed and body throbbing as if her flesh itself gasped for breath tattersail was slow to grasp that the sorcery had ceased even the voice shrieking in the back of her mind had fallen silent she raised bleary eyes to see moons spawn billowing smoke and ablaze in a dozen places on its ravaged mien moving away pulling back then it was past the city unsteady in its revolutions and leaning to one side moons spawn headed south towards the distant tahlyn mountainsshe looked around vaguely recalling that a company of soldiers had sought refuge on the blasted summit then something had hit her taking all she had left to resist it now nothing was left of the company but their armour always an even trade sorceress she fought against a sob then swung her attention to the first hilltayschrenn was down but alive a halfdozen marines scampered up the hillside to gather around the high mage a minute later they carried him awaybellurdan most of his clothing burned away and his flesh scorched red remained on the centre hill collecting nightchills scattered limbs and raising his voice in a mournful wail the sight in all its horror and pathos struck tattersails heart like a hammer on an anvil quickly she turned away damn you tayschrennpale had fallen the price was onearms host and four mages only now were the black moranth legions moving in tattersails jaw clenched her lips drawing from their fullness into a thin white linesomething tugged at her memory and she felt a growing certainty that this scene was not yet played outthe sorceress waitedthe warrens of magic dwelt in the beyond find the gate and nudge it open a crack what leaks out is yours to shape with these words a young woman set out on the path to sorcery open yourself to the warren that comes to youthat finds you draw forth its poweras much as your body and soul are capable of containingbut remember when the body fails the gate closestattersails limbs ached she felt as though someone had been beating her with clubs for the past two hours the last thing she had expected was that bitter taste on her tongue that said something nasty and ugly had come to the hilltop such warnings seldom came to a practitioner unless the gate was open a warren unveiled and bristling with powershed heard tales from other sorcerers and shed read mouldy scrolls that touched on moments like these when the power arrived groaning and deadly and each time it was said a god had stepped on to the mortal groundif she could have driven the nail of immortal presence in this place however it would have to be hood the god of death yet her instincts said no she didnt believe a god had arrived but something else hadwhat frustrated the sorceress was that she couldnt decide who among the people surrounding her was the dangerous one something kept drawing her gaze back to the young girl but the child seemed only half there most of the timethe voices behind her finally drew her attention sergeant whiskeyjack stood over quick ben and the other soldier both of whom still knelt at hairlocks side quick ben clutched an oblong object wrapped in hides and was looking up at his sergeant as if awaiting approvalthere was tension between the two men frowning tattersail walked over what are you doing she asked quick ben her eyes on the object in the wizards almost feminine hands he seemed not to have heard his eyes on the sergeantwhiskeyjack shot her a glance go ahead quick he growled then strode off to stand at the hills edge facing westtowards the moranth mountainsquick bens fine ascetic features tightened he nodded at his companion get ready kalamthe soldier named kalam leaned back on his haunches his hands in his sleeves the position seemed an odd response to quick bens request but the mage seemed satisfied tattersail watched as he laid one of his thin spidery hands on hairlocks trembling bloodsplashed chest he whispered a few chaining words and closed his eyesthat sounded like denul tattersail said glancing at kalam who remained motionless in his crouch but not quite she added slowlyhes twisted it somehow she fell silent then seeing something in kalam that reminded her of a snake waiting to strike wouldnt take much to set him off i think just a few more illtimed words a careless move towards quick ben or hairlock the man was big bearish but she remembered his dangerous glide past her snake indeed the mans a killer a soldier whos reached the next level in the art of murder not just a job any more this man likes it she wondered then if it wasnt this energy this quiet promise of menace that swept over her with the flavour of sexual tension tattersail sighed a day for perversityquick ben had resumed his chaining words this time over the object which he now set down beside hairlock she watched as enwreathing power enveloped the wrapped object watched in growing apprehension as the mage traced his long fingers along the hides seams the energy trickled from him with absolute control he was her superior in the lorehe had opened a warren she didnt even recognizewho are you people she whispered stepping backhairlocks eyes snapped open clear of pain and shock his gaze found tattersail and the stained smile came easily to his broken lips lost arts sail what youre about to see hasnt been done in a thousand yearshis face darkened then and the smile faded something burned in his eyes think back woman calot and i when we went down what did you see did you feel something something odd come on think look at me see my wound see how im lying which direction was i facing when that wave hitshe saw the fire in his eyes of anger mingled with triumph im not sure she said slowly something yes that detached reasoning part of her mind that had laboured with her throughout the battle that had screamed in her mind at calots death screamed in answer to the waves of sorceryto the fact that they had come from the plain her eyes narrowed on hairlock anomander rake never bothered to aim he was being indiscriminate those waves of power were aimed werent they coming at us from the wrong side she was trembling but why why would tayschrenn do thathairlock reached up one mangled hand and clutched quick bens cloak use her mage ill take the chancetattersails thoughts raced hairlock had been sent down into the tunnels by dujek and whiskeyjack and his squad had been down therea deal had been struck hairlock whats happening here she demanded fear clenching the muscles of her neck and shoulders what do you mean use meyoure not blind wornanquiet quick ben said he laid down the object on the wizards ravaged chest positioning it carefully so that it was centred lengthways along hairlocks breastbone the top end reached to just under the mans chin the bottom end extending a few inches beyond what was left of his torso webs of black energy spun incessantly over the hides mottled surfacequick ben passed a hand over the object and the web spread outwardthe glittering black threads traced a chaotic pattern that insinuated hairlocks entire body over flesh and through it the pattern ever changing the changes coming faster and faster hairlock jerked his eyes bulging then fell back a breath escaped his lungs in a slow steady hisswhen it ceased with a wet gurgle he did not draw anotherquick ben sat back on his haunches and glanced over at whiskeyjackthe sergeant was now facing them his expression unreadabletattersail wiped sweat from her brow with a grimy sleeve it didnt work then you failed to do whatever it was you were trying to doquick ben climbed to his feet kalam picked up the wrapped object and stepped close to tattersail the assassins eyes were dark penetrating as they searched her facequick ben spoke hold on to it sorceress take it back to your tent and unwrap it there above all dont let tayschrenn see ittattersail scowled what just like that her gaze fell on the objecti dont even know what id be accepting whatever it is i dont like itthe girl spoke directly behind her in a voice that was sharp and accusing i dont know what youve done wizard i felt you keeping me away that was unkindtattersail faced the girl then glanced back at quick ben what is all this the black mans expression was glacial but she saw a flicker around his eyes looked like fearwhiskeyjack rounded on the girl at her words you got something to say about all this recruit his tone was tightthe girls dark eyes slid to her sergeant she shrugged then walked awaykalam offered the object to tattersail answers he said quietly in a north seven cities accent melodic and round we all need answers sorceress the high mage killed your comrades look at us were all thats left of the bridgeburners answers arent easily attained will you pay the pricewith a final glance at hairlocks lifeless bodyso brutally torn apartand the lifeless stare of his eyes she accepted the object it felt light in her hands whatever was within the hide cocoon was slight in size parts of it moved and against her grip she felt knobs and shafts of something hard she stared at the assassins bearish face i want she said slowly to see tayschrenn get what he deservesthen were in agreement kalam said smiling this is where it startstattersail felt her stomach jump at that smile woman whats got into you she sighed done as she turned away to descend the slope and make her way back to the main camp she caught the girls eye a chill rippled through her the sorceress stopped you recruit she called whats your namethe girl smiled as if at a private joke sorrytattersail grunted it figured she tucked the package under an arm and staggered down the slopesergeant whiskeyjack kicked at a helmet and watched as it tumbled and bounced down the hillside he spun and glared at quick ben its donethe wizards eyes darted to sorry then he noddedyou will draw unwarranted attention on our squad the young girl told whiskeyjack high mage tayschrenn will noticethe sergeant raised an eyebrow unwarranted attention what the hell does that meansorry made no replywhiskeyjack bit back sharp words what had fiddler called her an uncanny bitch hed said it to her face and shed just stared him down with those dead stony eyes as much as he hated to admit it whiskeyjack shared the sappers crude assessment what made things even more disturbing this fifteenyearold girl had quick ben scared half out of his wits and the wizard didnt want to talk about it what had the empire sent himhis gaze swung back to tattersail she was crossing the killing field below the ravens rose screaming from her path and remained circling overhead their caws uneasy and frightened the sergeant felt kalams solid presence at his sidehoods breath whiskeyjack muttered that sorceress seems an unholy terror as far as those birds are concernednot her kalam said its what shes carryingwhiskeyjack scratched his beard his eyes narrowing this stinks you sure its necessarykalam shruggedwhiskeyjack quick ben said behind them they kept us in the tunnels do you think the high mage couldnt have guessed what would happenthe sergeant faced his wizard a dozen paces beyond stood sorry well within hearing range whiskeyjack scowled at her but said nothingafter a moment of heavy silence the sergeant turned his attention to the city the last of the moranth legions was marching beneath the west gates arch columns of black smoke rose from behind the battered scarred walls he knew something of the history of grim enmity between the moranth and the citizens of the once free city of pale contested trade routes two mercantile powers at each others throat and pale won more often than not at long last it seemed that the blackarmoured warriors from beyond the western mountains whose faces remained hidden behind the chitinous visors on their helms and who spoke in clicks and buzzes were evening the score faintly beyond the cries of carrion birds came the wail of men women and children dying beneath the swordsounds like the empress is keeping her word with the moranth quick ben said quietly an hour of slaughter i didnt think dujekdujek knows his orders whiskeyjack cut in and theres a high mage taloned on his shoulderan hour kalam repeated then we clean up the messnot our squad whiskeyjack said weve received new ordersthe two men stared at their sergeantand you still need convincing quick ben demanded theyre driving us into the ground they mean toenough whiskeyjack barked not now kalam find fiddler we need resupply from the moranth round up the rest quick and take sorry with you join me outside the high fists tent in an hourand you quick ben asked what are you going to dothe sergeant heard an illconcealed yearning in the wizards voice the man needed a direction or maybe confirmation that they were doing the right thing a little late for that even so whiskeyjack felt a pang of regrethe couldnt give what quick ben wanted the most he couldnt tell him that things would turn out for the best he sank down on his haunches his eyes on pale what am i going to do im going to do some thinking quick ben ive been listening to you and kalam to mallet and fiddler even trotts has been jawing in my ear well now its my turn so leave me be wizard and take that damn girl with youquick ben flinched seeming to withdraw something in whiskeyjacks words had made him very unhappyor maybe everythingthe sergeant was too tired to worry about it he had their new assignment to think over had he been a religious man whiskeyjack would have let blood in hoods bowl calling upon the shades of his ancestors as much as he hated to admit it he shared the feeling among his squad someone in the empire wanted the bridgeburners deadpale was behind them now the nightmare nothing but the taste of ashes in his mouth ahead lay their next destination the legendary city of darujhistan whiskeyjack had a premonition that a new nightmare was about to begindown in the camp just beyond the last crest of denuded hills horsedrawn carts loaded with wounded soldiers crowded the narrow aisles between the tent rows all the precise order of the malazan encampment had disintegrated and the air was febrile with soldiers screaming their pain giving voice to horrortattersail threaded her way around the dazed survivors stepping across puddles of blood in the wagonruts her eyes lingering on an obscene pile of amputated limbs outside the cutter tents from the massive sprawl of the camp followers slum of tents and shelters came a wailing dirgea broken chorus of thousands of voices the sound a chilling reminder that war was always a thing of griefin some military headquarters back in the empires capital of unta three thousand leagues distant an anonymous aide would paint a red stroke across the nd army on the active list and then write in fine script beside it pale late winter the rd year of burns sleep thus would the death of nine thousand men and women be noted and then forgottentattersail grimaced some of us wont forget the bridgeburners harboured some frightening suspicions the thought of challenging tayschrenn in a direct confrontation appealed to her sense of outrage andif the high mage had killed calother feeling of betrayal but she knew that her emotions had a way of running away with her a sorcery duel with the empires high mage would buy her a quick passage to hoods gate selfrighteous wrath had planted more corpses in the around than an empire could lav claim to and as calot used to sayshake your fist all you want but dead is dead shed witnessed all too many scenes of death since shed first joined the ranks of the malazan empire but at least they couldnt be laid squarely at her feet that was the difference and it had been enough for a long time not as i once was ive spent twenty years washing the blood from my hands right now however the scene that rose again and again behind her eyes was the empty armour on the hilltop and it gnawed at her heart those men and women had been running to her looking for protection against the horrors of the plain below it had been a desperate act a fatal one but she understood it tayschrenn didnt care about them but she did she was one of their own in past battles theyd fought like rabid dogs to keep enemy legions from killing her this time them instead of shielding my own hide shed been surviving on instinct back then and her instincts had had nothing to do with altruism those it was a mage war her territory favours were traded in the nd its what kept everyone alive and it was what had made the nd a legion of legend those soldiers had expectations and they had the right to themtheyd come to her for salvation and they died for itand if i had sacrificed myself then cast my warrens defences on to being alive tattersail concluded as she approached her tent isnt the same as feeling good about it she entered her tent and closed the flap behind her then stood surveying her worldly possessions scant few after two hundred and nineteen years of life the oak chest containing her book of thyr sorcery remained sealed by warding spells the small collection of alchemical devices lay scattered on the tabletop beside her cot like a childs toys abandoned in midgameamid the clutter sat her deck of dragons her gaze lingered on the reading cards before continuing its round everything looked different now as if the chest the alchemy and her clothes all belonged to someone else someone younger someone still possessing a shred of vanityonly the deckthe fatidcalled out to her like an old friendtattersail walked over to stand before it with an absent gesture she set down the package given her by kalam then pulled out a stool from under the table sitting down she reached for the deck she hesitatedit had been months something had kept her away maybe calots death could have been foretold and maybe that suspicion had been pacing in the darkness of her thoughts all this time pain and fear had been shaping her soul all her life but her time with calot had been another kind of shaping something light happy pleasantly floatingshed called it mere diversionhows that for wilful denial she heard the bitterness in her tone and hated herself for it her old demons were back laughing at the death of her illusions you refused the deck once before the night before mocks throat was opened the night before dancer and the man who would one day rule an empire stole into your mastersyour lovershold would you deny that a pattern exists womanher vision blurry with memories shed thought buried for ever she looked down at the deck blinking rapidly do i want you to talk to me old friend do i need your reminders your wry confirmation that faith is for foolsa motion caught the corner of her eye whatever was inside the bound hide had moved lumps rose here and there pushing against the seamstattersail stared then her breath catching she reached to it and set it in front of her she withdrew a small dagger from her belt and began to cut the seams the object within went still as if awaiting the result of her efforts she peeled back a sliced flap of hidesail said a familiar voiceher eyes widened as a wooden marionette wearing bright yellow silk clothing climbed out of the bag painted on its round face were features she recognizedhairlockgood to see you again the marionette said rising to its feet it wobbled and held out artfully carved hands to regain balance and the soul did shift he said doffing his floppy hat and managing an unsteady bowsoul shifting but thats been lost for centuries not even tayschrenn she stopped pursing her lips her thoughts racedlater hairlock said he took a few steps then bent his head forward to study his new body well he sighed one mustnt quibble must onehe looked up and fixed painted eyes on the sorceress you have to go to my tent before the thought occurs to tayschrenn i need my book youre part of this now theres no turning backpart of whathairlock made no reply having broken his uncanny stare he lowered himself down to his knees thought i smelled a deck he saidsweat ran in cold rivulets under tattersails arms hairlock had made her uneasy at the best of times but this she could smell her own fearthat hed swung his gaze from her made her grateful for small merciesthis was elder magic kurald galain if the legends were true and it was deadly vicious raw and primal the bridgeburners had a reputation for being a mean crowd but to walk the warrens closest to chaos was pure madness or desperationalmost of its own accord her thyr warren opened and a surge of power filled her weary body her eyes snapped to the deckhairlock must have sensed it tattersail he whispered amusement it his tone come the fatid calls to you read what is to be readprofoundly disturbed by her own answering flush of excitement tattersail reluctantly reached for the deck of dragons she saw her hand tremble as it closed on it she shuffled slowly feeling the chill of the lacquered wooden cards seep into her fingers and then her arms i feel a storm raging in them already she said trimming the deck and setting it down on the tabletophairlocks answering laugh was eager and mean first house sets the course quicklyshe turned over the top card her breath caught knight of darkhairlock sighed the lord of night rules this game of coursetattersail studied the painted figure the face remained blurred as always did the knight was naked his skin jet black from the hips up he was human heavily muscled holding aloft a black twohanded sword that trailed smoky ethereal chains drifting off into the backgrounds empty darkness his lower body was draconian its armoured scales black paling to grey at the belly as always she saw something new something she had never seen before that pertained to the momentthere was a shape suspended in the darkness above the knights head she could only detect it on the edge of her vision a vague hint that vanished when she focused on the place itself of course you never give up the truth so easily do yousecond card hairlock urged crouching close to the playing field inscribed on the tabletopshe flipped the second card oponn the twofaced jester of chancehoods curse on their meddling ways hairlock growledthe lady held the upright position her male twins bemused stare upside down at the cards foot thus the thread of luck that pulled back rather than pushed forwardthe thread of success the ladys expression seemed soft almost tender a new facet marking how things now balanced a second heretofore unseen detail caught tattersails intense study where the lords right hand reached up to touch the ladys left a tiny silver disc spanned the space between them the sorceress leaned forward squinting a coin and on the face a male headshe blinked no female then male then female she sat back suddenlythe coin was spinningnext hairlock demanded you are too slowtattersail saw that the marionette was paying no attention to the card oponn and had in fact probably given it only sufficient notice to identify it she drew a deep breath hairlock and the bridgeburners were tied up in this she knew that instinctively but her own role was as yet undecided with these two cards she already knew more than they did it still wasnt much but it might be enough to keep her alive in what was to come she released her breath all at once reached forward and slammed a palm down on the deckhairlock jumped then whirled to her you hold on this he raged you hold on the fool the second card absurd play on womanno tattersail replied sweeping the two cards into her hands and returning them to the deck ive chosen to hold and theres nothing you can do about it she rosebitch i can kill you in the blink of an eye here and nowfine tattersail said a good excuse for missing tayschrenns debriefing by all means proceed hairlock crossing her arms she waitedthe marionette snarled no he said i have need of you and you despise tayschrenn even more than i he cocked his head reconsidering his last words then barked a laugh thus i am assured there will be no betrayaltattersail thought about that you are right she said she turned and walked to the tent flap her hand closed on the rough canvas then she stopped hairlock how well can you hearwell enough the marionette growled behind herdo you hear anything then a spinning coincamp sounds is all why what do you heartattersail smiled without answering she pulled aside the tent flap and went outside as she headed towards the command tent a strange hope sang through hershed never held oponn as an ally calling on luck in anything was sheer idiocy the first house she had placed darkness touched her hand icecold loud with the crashing waves of violence and power run amokand yet an odd flavour there something like salvation the knight could be enemy or ally or more likely neither just out there unpredictable selfabsorbed but oponn rode the warriors shadow leaving house dark tottering on the edge suspended in a place between night and day more than anything else it had been oponns spinning coin that had demanded her choice to holdhairlock heard nothing wonderfuleven now as she approached the command tent the faint sound continued in her head as it would for some time she believed the coin spun and spun oponn whirled two faces to the cosmos but it was the ladys bet spin o silver spin onchapter threethelomen tartheno

horizon for the first sighting of land it would come and it would come soonhe leaned against the sloping wall opposite his bunk watching the lanterns sway and idly tossing his dagger into the lone tables centre pole which was now studded with countless tiny holesa cool musty brush of air swept across his face and he turned to see topper emerge from the imperial warren it had been two years since hed last seen the claw master hoods breath man paran said cant you manage to find another colour of cloth this perverse love of green must surely be curablethe tall halfblood tiste and seemed to be wearing the same clothes as the last time paran had seen him green wool green leather only the countless rings spearing his long fingers showed any splash of contrary colour the claw master had arrived in a sour mood and parans opening words had not improved it you imagine i enjoy such journeys captain seeking out a ship on the ocean is a challenge of sorcery few could manazemakes you a reliable messenger then paran mutteredi see youve made no effort to improve on courtesy captaini admit i understand nothing of the adjuncts faith in youdont lose sleep over it topper now youve found me what is the the man scowled shes with the bridgeburners outside pale the siege continues how old is your informationless than a week which is as long as ive been hunting you in any case he continued the deadlock is about to be brokenparan grunted then he frowned which squadyou know them allyes paran assertedtoppers scowl deepened then he raised a hand and began examining his rings whiskeyjacks shes one of his recruitsparan closed his eyes it should not have surprised him the gods are playing with me question is which gods oh whiskeyjack you once commanded an army back when laseen was named surly back when you could have listened to your companion when you could have made a choice you couldve stopped surly hell perhaps you could have stopped me but now you command a squad just a squad and shes the empress and me im a fool who followed his dream and now all i desire is its end he opened his eyes and regarded topper whiskeyjack the war of seven cities through the breach at aren the holy desert raraku panpotsun nathilogall in the emperors time paranso paran said im to take command of whiskeyjacks squad the mission will take us to darulhistan to the city of citiesyour recruit is showing her powers topper said grimacing shes corrupted the bridgeburners possibly even dujek onearm and the entire second and third armies on genabackisyou cant be serious besides my concern is with the recruit with her only her the adjunct agrees weve waited long enough now youre telling me weve waited too long i cant believe dujeks about to become a renegadenot dujek not whiskeyjack eitheryou are to proceed as planned but i have been instructed to remind you that secrecy is paramount now more than ever an agent of the claw will contact you once you reach pale trust no one else your recruits found her weapon and with it she means to strike at the heart of the empire failure cannot be considered toppers odd eyes glinted if you now feel unequal to the taskparan studied the man standing before him if its as bad as you describe why not send in a hand of claw assassinsthe man sighed as if hed somehow heard parans silent question a god is using her captain she wont die easily the plan for dealing with her has required adjustments expansion in fact additional threats must be taken care of but these are threads already woven do as you have been commanded all risk must be removed if we are to take darujhistan and the empress wants darujhistan she also feels it is time for dujek onearm to be he smiled disarmedwhyhe has a following its still held that the emperor had old onearm in mind as his heirparan snorted the emperor planned to rule for ever topper this suspicion of laseens is plain ridiculous and persists only because it justifies her paranoiacaptain topper said quietly greater men than you have died for less the empress expects obedience of her servants and demands loyaltyany reasonable ruler would have the expectation and the demand the other way roundtoppers mouth thinned to a pale line assume command of the squad stay close to the recruit but otherwise do nothing to make her suspicious of you once in place you are to wait understoodparan looked away his gaze finding the porthole beyond was blue sky there were too many omissions halftruths and outright lies in this this chaotic mess how will i play it when the time comes the recruit must die at least that much is certain but the rest whiskeyjack i remember you you stood tall then and in my dreams i never imagined this growing nightmare will i have your blood on my bands when all this is done at the very heart of things he realized he no longer knew who was the ultimate betrayer in all this if a betrayer there must be was the empire the empress or was it something else a legacy an ambition a vision at the far end of peace and wealth for all or was it a beast that could not cease devouring darujhistanthe greatest city in the world would it come to the empire in flames was there wisdom in opening its gates within the troubled borders of the malazan empire people lived in such peace as their ancestors had never imagined and if not for the claw for the endless wars in distant lands there would be freedom as well had this been the emperors dream at the very beginning did it matter any moreare my instructions understood captainhe glanced over at the man and waved a hand well enoughsnarling topper spread wide his arms the imperial warren yawned behind him he stepped back and was goneparan leaned forward his head in his handsit was the season of currents and in the port city of genabaris the heavy malazan transports rocked and twisted straining at their ropes like massive beasts the piers unused to such gargantuan craft moored alongside them creaked ominously with every wayward savage pull on the bollardscrates and clothwrapped bundles crowded the yards supplies fresh in from the seven cities and destined for the front lines supply clerks clambered over them like monkeys hunting sigils of identification and chattering to each other over the heads of clockmen and soldiersthe agent leaned against a crate at the foot of the pier his burly arms crossed and his small narrow eyes fixed on the officer sitting on a bundle some thirty yards further down the pier neither had moved in the last hourthe agent was having a hard time convincing himself that this was the man hed been sent to retrieve he looked awfully young and as green as the rancid water of this bay his uniform still bore its makers chalk lines and the leather grip of his longsword showed not a single sweatstain he had the stink of nobility about him like a perfumed cloud and for the past hour hed just been sitting there hands in lap shoulders hunched watching like some stupid cow the frenzied activity swirling around him though he ranked captain not a single soldier even bothered to salute himthe stink wasnt subtlethe adjunct must have been knocked on her head during that last assassination attempt on the empress it was the only possible explanation for this farce of a man rating the kind of service the agent was about to deliver in person yet these days he concluded sourly the whole show was being run by idiotswith a loud sigh the agent pushed himself upright and sauntered over to the officerthe man didnt even know he had company until the agent stepped in front of him then he looked upthe agent did some quick rethinking something in this mans gaze was dangerous there was a glitter there buried deep that made the mans eyes seem older than the rest of his face narne the agents question was a strained grunttook your time about it the captain said risinga tall bastard too the agent scowled he hated tall bastards whore you waiting for captainthe man looked up the pier the waitings over lets walk ill just take it on faith you know where were going he reached down and retrieved a duffel bag then took the leadthe agent moved up beside the captain fine he growled be that way they left the pier and the agent turned them up the first street on the right a green quorl came in last night youll be taken directly to cloud forest and from there a black will take you into palethe captain gave the agent a blank stareyou never heard of quorlsno i assume theyre a means of transportation why else would i be removed from a ship a thousand leagues distant from palethe moranth use them and were using the moranth the agent scowled to himself using them a lot these days the green do most of the courier stuff and moving people around like you and me but the black are stationed in pale and the different clans dont like to mix the moranth are made up of a bunch of clans got colours for names and wear them too nobody gets confused that wayand im to ride with a green on a quorlyou got it captainthey headed up a narrow street malazan guards milled around every crossing hands on their weaponsthe captain returned a salute from one such squad having trouble with insurrections he askedinsurrections yeah trouble nolets see if i understand you correctly the captains tone was stiff instead of delivering me by ship to a point nearest pale im to ride overland with a bunch of halfhuman barbarians who smell like grasshoppers and dress like them too and this way no one will notice especially since itll take us a year to get to pale and by then everything will have gone all to hell correct so fargrinning the agent shook his head despite his hatred for tall men or rather men taller than himself he felt his guard going down at least this one talked straightand for a noble that was pretty impressive maybe lorn still had the old stuff after all you said overland well hell yes captain way overland he stopped at a nondescript doorway and turned to the man quorls you see they fly they got wings four in fact and you can see right through every one of them and if youre of a mind you can poke your finger through one of those wings only dont do it when youre a quartermile up right cause it may be a long way down but itll seem awfully fast at the time you hear me captain he opened the door beyond rose a staircasethe mans face had lost its colour so much for intelligence reports he mutteredthe agents grin widened we see them before you do lifes on a needtoknow remember that captain the mans smile was the only answer he gavethey entered and closed the door behind thema young marine intercepted tattersail as she made her way across the compound in what was now empire headquarters in pale the boys face had bewilderment written all over it and he opened his mouth a few times before any words came outsorceressshe stopped the thought of having tayschrenn wait a little longer appealed to her what is it soldierthe marine stole a glance over one shoulder then said the guards sorceress theyve got something of a problem they sent me towho which guards take me to themyes sorceressshe followed the marine around the nearest corner of the main building where the compound wall ran close creating a narrow passage running the buildings length at the far end knelt a figure his bare head bowed beside him was a large lumpy burlap sack covered in brown stains clouds of flies swarmed around both the man and the sackthe marine halted and turned to the sorceress he still hasnt moved the guards keep getting sick when they patrol through heretattersail stared at the huddled man a sudden welling of tears behind her eyes ignoring the marine she strode into the aisle the stench hit her like a wall damn she thought hes been here since the battle five daysthe sorceress came closer though bellurdan knelt his head came near to her own height the thelomen high mage still wore what was left of his battle garb the ragged strips of fur scorched and torn the rough weave of fragments of tunic stained with blood as she arrived to stop before him she saw that his neck and face were covered in burn blisters and most of his hair was goneyou look terrible bellurdan she saidthe giants head slowly turned redrimmed eyes focused on her faceah he rumbled tattersail his exhausted smile cracked the charred flesh of one cheek the wound gaped red and drythat smile almost broke her down you need healing old friend her gaze flicked to the burlap sack its surface crawled with flies come on nightchill would bite your head off if she could see you now she felt trembling steal into her but grimly pressed on well take care of her bellurdan you and me but well need our strength to do thatthe thelomen shook his head slowly i choose this tattersail the scars without are the scars within he drew a deep breath i will survive these wounds and i alone will raise my loves barrow but the time is not yet right he laid a massive hand on the sack tayschrenn has given me leave to do this will you do the sametattersail was shocked to feel the surge of anger rising up in her tayschrenn gave you leave did he to her own ears her voice sound brutal a harsh grating of sarcasm she saw bellurdan flinch and seem withdraw and a part of her wanted to wail to throw her arms around the giant and weep but rage possessed her that bastard killed nightchill bellurdan the moons lord had neither the time nor the inclination to raise demons think about it tayschrenn had the time prepareno the thelomens voice thundered down the aisle he surged to his feet and tattersail stepped back the giant looked ready to tear down the walls a desperate fire in his eyes his hands closed into fists then his glare fixed on her he seemed to freeze all at once his shoulder slumped his hands opened and his eyes dimmed no he said again this time in a tone filled with sorrow tayschrenn is our protector as has always been tattersail remember the very beginning the emperor was mad but tayschrenn stood at his side he shaped the empire dream and so opposed the emperors nightmare we underestimated lord of moons spawn that is alltattersail stared up at bellurdans ravaged face the memory of hairlocks torn body returned to her there was an echo there but she couldnt quite catch it i remember the beginning she said softly doing some searching of her own the memories remained sharp but whatever thread there was that connected then to now still eluded her she wanted desperately to talk to quick ben but she had seen nothing of the bridgeburners since the day of the battle theyd left her with hairlock and that puppet scared her more and more with every passing day particularly now that hed found a grudge to hold on tothe scene with the deck of dragons still smartedand he worked it by keeping her in the dark the emperor had a knack for gathering the right people around him she continued but he wasnt a fool he knew the betrayal would come from that group what made us the right people was our power i remember bellurdan she shook her head the emperors gone but the powers still heretattersails breath caught and thats it she said half to herself tayschrenns the threadthe emperor was insane bellurdan said else he would have protected himself bettertattersail frowned at that the thelomen had a point like shed just said that old man wasnt a fool so what had happened im sorry we must talk later the high mage has summoned me bellurdan will we talk laterthe giant nodded as you wish soon i will depart to raise nightchills barrow far out on the rhivi plain i thinktattersail glanced back up the aisle the marine still stood there shifting from one foot to the other bellurdan would you mind if i cast a sealing spell on her remainshis eyes clouded and he looked down at the sack the guards are unhappy its true he thought for a moment then said yes tattersail you may do thatit smells bad from here to the throne kalam said his scarred face twisted with worry he sat crouched on his haunches absently scratching the lines of a web on the ground with his dagger then looked up at his sergeantwhiskeyjack eyed pales stained walls the muscles of his jaw bunching beneath his beard the last time i stood on this hill he said his gaze narrowing it was crowded with armour and a mage and a half he was silent for a time then he sighed go on corporalkalam nodded i pulled some old threads he said squinting against the harsh morning light somebody high up has us marked could be the court itself or maybe the nobilitytheres rumours theyre back at it behind the scenes he grimaced and now weve got some new captain from unta eager to get our throats cut four captains in the last three years not one worth his weight in saltquick ben stood ten feet away at the hills crest his arms crossed he now spoke you heard the plan come on whiskeyjack that man slid straight out of the palace and into our laps on a stream ofquiet whiskeyjack muttered im thinkingkalam and quick ben exchanged glancesa long minute passed on the road below troop wagons rattled in the ruts leading into the city remnants of the th and th armies already battered almost broken by caladan brood and the crimson guardwhiskeyjack shook his head the only force intact was the moranth they seemed determined to field only the black regiments using the gr for lifts and dropsand where the hell was the gold hed been hearing much about damn those unhuman bastards anyway pales gutters ran red from their hour of retribution once the burial shifts were through thered be a few more hills outside the citys walls big onesthere would be nothing to mark thirteen hundred dead bridgeburners though the worms didnt need to travel far to feast on those bodies what chilled the sergeant to his bones was the fact that apart from a few survivors nobody had made a serious effort to save them some high ranking officer had delivered tayschrenns commiserations on those lost in the line of duty then had unloaded a wagonload of tripe about heroism and sacrifice his audience of thirtynine stonefaced soldiers looked on without a word the officer was found dead in his room hours later expertly garotted the mood was badnobody in regiment would have even thought of something so ugly five years ago but now they didnt blink at the newsgarottesounds like claw work kalam had suggested it was a setup an elaborate frame to discredit what was left of the bridgeburners whiskeyjack was scepticalhe tried to clear his thoughts if there was a pattern it would be a simple one simple enough to pass by unnoticed but exhaustion see in like a thick haze behind his eyes he took a deep lungful of the morning air the new recruit he askedkalam rose from his haunches with a grunt a faraway and longlook entered his eyes maybe he said finally pretty young for a claw thoughi never believed in pure evil before sorry showed up quick ben said but youre right shes awfully young how long are they trained before theyre sent outkalam shrugged uneasily fifteen years minimum mind you they them young five or sixcould be magery involved making her look younger than she is quick ben said highlevel stuff but within tayschrenns abilitiesseems too obvious whiskeyjack muttered call it bad upbringing quick ben snorted dont tell me you believe that whiskeyjackthe sergeants face tightened the subjects closed on sorry and dont tell me what i think wizard he faced kalam all right you think empires into killing its own these days you think laseens cleaning house maybe or someone close to her getting rid of certain people fine tell me whythe old guard kalam replied immediately everyone still loyal to emperors memorydoesnt wash whiskeyjack said were all dying off anyway we dont need laseens help apart from dujek theres not a man in this army here who even knows the emperors name and nobodyd give a damn in any case hes dead long live the empressshe aint got the patience to wait it out quick ben saidkalam nodded agreement shes losing momentum as it is things used to be betterits that memory she wants deadhairlocks our snake in the hole quick ben said with a sharp noditll work whiskeyjack i know what im doing on this onewe do it the way the emperor would have kalam added we turn the game we do our own housecleaningwhiskeyjack raised a hand all right now be quiet youre both sounding too damn rehearsed he paused its a theory a complicated one whos in the know and who isnt he scowled at quick bens expression right thats hairlocks task but what happens when you come face to face with someone big powerful and meanlike tayschrenn the wizard grinnedright im sure youve got an answer lets see if i can work it out myself you look for someone even nastier you make a deal and you set things up and if were quick enough well come out smelling of roses am i close wizardkalam snorted his amusementquick ben looked away back in the seven cities before the empire showed upback in the seven cities is back in the seven cities whiskeyjack said hell i led the company chasing you across the desert remember i know how you work quick and i know youre damn good at this but i also recall that you were the only one of your cabal to come out alive back then and this timethe wizard seemed hurt by whiskeyjacks words his lips thinned to a straight linethe sergeant sighed all right we go with it start things rolling and pull that sorceress all the way in well need her if hairlock breaks his chainsand sorry kalam askedwhiskeyjack hesitated he knew the question behind that questionquick ben was the squads brains but kalam was their killer both made him uneasy with their singleminded devotion to their respective talentsleave her alone he said at last for nowkalam and quick ben sighed sharing a grin behind their sergeants backjust dont get cocky whiskeyjack said drilythe grins fadedthe sergeants gaze returned to the wagons entering the city two riders approached all right he said mount up here comes our reception committee the riders were from his squad fiddler and sorryyou think the new captains arrived kalam asked as he climbed into his saddle his roan mare turned her head and snapped at him he growled in return a moment later the two longtime companions settled down into their mutual mistrustwhiskeyjack looked on amused probably lets head down to them anybody up on the wall watching us might be getting antsy then his humour fell away they had indeed just turned the game and the timing couldnt have been worse he knew the full extent of their next mission and in that he knew more than either quick ben or kalamthere was no point in complicating things even further though theyll find out soon enoughtattersail stood half a dozen feet behind high mage tayschrenn the malazan banners snapped in the wind the spars creaking above the smokestained turret but here in the shelter of the wall the air was calmon the western horizon across from her rose the moranth mountains reaching a mangled arm northward to genabaris as the range swept southward it joined the tahlyn in a jagged line stretching a thousand leagues into the east off to her right lay the flat yellowgrassed rhivi plaintayschrenn leaned on a merlon looking down on the wagons rolling into the city from below rose the groans of oxen and shouting soldiersthe high mage hadnt moved or said a word in some minutes off to his left waited a small wood table its surface scarred and pitted and crowded with runes cut deep into the oak peculiar dark stains blotted the surface here and thereknots of tension throbbed in tattersails shoulders meeting bellurdan had shaken her and she didnt feel up to what was to comebridgeburners the high mage mutteredstartled the sorceress frowned then stepped up to stand beside tayschrenn descending from a hill off to the right a hill she knew intimately rode a party of soldiers even from this distance she recognized four of them quick ben kalam whiskeyjack and that recruit sorrythe fifth rider was a short wiry man who had sapper written all over him oh she said feigning lack of interestwhiskeyjacks squad tayschrenn said he turned his full gaze on the sorceress the same squad you spoke with immediately following the moons retreat the high mage smiled then clapped tattersails shoulder come i require a reading lets begin he walked over to stand before the table oponns strands are twisting a peculiar maze the influence snares me again and again he turned his back to the wall and sat down on a crenel then looked up tattersail he said soberly in matters of empire i am the servant of the empresstattersail recalled their argument at the debriefing nothing had been resolved perhaps i should take my complaints to her thentayschrenns brows rose i take that as sarcasticyou dothe high mage said stiffly i do and be thankful for it womantattersail pulled out her deck and held it against her stomach running her fingers over the top card cool a feeling of great weight and darkness she set the deck in the tables centre then lowered her bulk slowly into a kneeling position her gaze locked with tayschrenns shall we begintell me of the spinning cointattersails breath caught she could not movefirst card tayschrenn commandedwith an effort she expelled the air from her lungs in a hissing sighdamn him she thought an echo of laughter sounded in her head and she realized that someone something had opened the way an ascendant was reaching through her its presence cool and amused almost fickle her eyes shut of their own accord and she reached for the first card she flipped it almost haphazardly to her right eyes still closed she felt herself smile an unaligned card orb judgement and true sight the second card she tossed to the left side of the field virgin high house death here scarred and blindfolded with blood on her hands faintly as if from a great distance away came the sound of horses thundering closer now beneath her as if the earth had swallowed themthen the sound rose anew behind her she felt herself nod the recruitthe blood on her hands is not her own the crime not its own the cloth against her eyes is wetshe slapped the third card immediately in front of her behind her lids an image formed it left her cold and frightened assassin high house shadow the rope a count of knots unending the patron of assassins is in this game for a moment she thought she heard the howling of uounamp skit laii aliana on tiat fourtki catcx and felt a tlafikk of recognition ripple through her followed by something like false modestyoponn ladys head high lords low she picked it up and set it down opposite tayschrenntheres your block she smiled to herself chew on it awhile high mage the lady regards you with disgust tattersail knew he must be burning with questions but he wouldnt speak them there was too much power behind this opening had he sensed the ascendants presence she wondered if it scared himthe coin she heard herself say spins on high mage its face looks upon many a handful perhaps and here is their card she set the fifth card to oponns right edges touching another unaligned card crown wisdom and justice as it is upright around it a fair citys walls lit by flames of gas blue and green she pondered yes darujhistan the last free citythe way closed the ascendant withdrawing as if bored tattersails eyes opened an unexpected warmth comforting her weary body into oponns maze she said amused at the truth hidden in that statement i can take it no further high magetayschrenns breath gusted out and he leaned back youve gone far past what ive managed sorceress his face was drawn as he looked at her im impressed with your source though not pleased with its messagehe frowned planting his elbows on his knees and steepling his longfingered hands before his face this spinning coin ever echoing theres the jesters humour in this shapingeven now i feel we are being misled deaths virgin a likely deceitit was now tattersails turn to be impressed the high mage was an adept then had he too heard the laughter punctuating the laying of the field she hoped not you might be right she said the virgins face is ever changingit could be anyone cant say the same for oponn or the ropes she nodded a very possible deception she said pleased to be conversing with an equala truth that made her grimace inwardlyits always better when hatred and outrage stay pure uncompromisedi would hear your thoughts tayschrenn saidtattersail started shied from the high mages steady gaze she began collecting the cards would it hurt to offer some explanation if anything it will leave him even more rattled than be already is deception is the patron assassins forte i sensed nothing of his presumed master shadowthrone himself makes me suspect the rope is on his own here beware the assassin high mage if anything his games are even more subtle than shadowthrones and while oponn plays their own version it remains the same game and that game is being played out in our world the twins of luck have no control in shadows realm and shadow is a warren known for slipping its boundaries for breaking the rulestrue enough tayschrenn said rising to his feet with a grunt the birth of that bastard realm has ever troubled meits young yet tattersail said she picked up her deck and returned it to the pocket inside her cloak its final shaping is still centuries away and it may never happen recall other new houses that ended up dying a quick deaththis one stinks of too much power tayschrenn returned to his study of the moranth mountains my gratitude he said as tattersail went to the steps leading down into the city is worth something i hope in any case sorceress you have ittattersail hesitated at the landing then began the descent hed be less magnanimous if he found out that she had just misled him she could guess the virgins identity her thoughts travelled back to the moment of the virgins appearance the horses she had heard passing beneath hadnt been an illusion whiskeyjacks squad had just entered the city through the gate below and among them rode sorry coincidencemaybe but she didnt think so the spinning coin had faintly wobbled at that instant then its ringing returned though she heard it in her mind day and night it had become almost second nature and tattersail found she had to concentrate to find it but shed caught the nudge felt the pitch change and sensed a brief instant of uncertaintydeaths virgin and the assassin of high house shadow there was a connection there somehow and it bothered oponn obviously everything remained in a flux terrific she muttered as she reached the bottom of the staircaseshe saw the young marine who had approached her earlier he stood in a line of recruits in the centre of the compound no commanding officer was in sight tattersail called the boy overyes sorceress he asked as he arrived to stand at attention in front of herwhat are you all standing around for soldierwere about to be issued our weapons the staff sergeants gone to bring the wagon roundtattersail nodded i have a task for you ill see that you get your weaponsbut not the tinny ones your friends are about to receive if a superior officer questions your absence refer him to meyes sorceressa pang of regret hit tattersail upon meeting the boys bright eager gaze chances were hed be dead within a few months the empire had many crimes staining its banner but this was the worst of them she sighed deliver in person this message to sergeant whiskeyjack bridgeburners the fat lady with the spells wants to talk you have it soldierthe boy blanchedlets hear itthe marine repeated the message in a deadpan tonetattersail smiled very good now run along and dont forget to get an answer from him ill be in my quarterscaptain paran swung around for a last look at the black moranth the squad had just reached the plateaus crest he watched until they disappeared from view then shifted his gaze back to the city in the eastfrom this distance with the wide flat plain in between pale seemed peaceful enough although the ground outside the walls was studded with black basaltic rubble and the memory of smoke and fire clung to the air along the wall scaffolding rose in places tiny figures crowding the frameworks they appeared to be rebuilding huge gaps in the stoneworkfrom the north gate a sluggish stream of wagons wound out towards the hills the air above them filled with crows along the edge of those hills ran a line of mounds too regular to be naturalhed heard the rumours here and there five dead mages two of them high mages the nds losses enough to fire speculation that it would be merged with the th and the th to form a new regiment and moons spawn had retreated south across the tahlyn mountains to lake azur trailing smoke drifting and leaning to one side like a spent thunderheadbut one tale reached into the captains thoughts deeper than all the rest the bridgeburners were gone some stories said killed to a man others insisted that a few squads had made it out of the tunnels before the collapseparan was frustrated hed been among moranth for days the uncanny warriors hardly ever spoke and when they did it was to each other in that incomprehensible tongue of theirs all of his information was out of date and that put him in an unfamiliar position mind you he thought since genabaris it had been one unfamiliar situation after anotherso here he was on the waiting end of things once again he readjusted his duffel bag and was preparing for a long wait when he saw a horseman top the far plateaus crest the man had an extra mount with him and he rode straight for the captainhe sighed dealing with the claw always grated they were so damn smug with the exception of that man in genabaris none seemed to like him much it had been a long time since hed known someone he could call a friend over two years in factthe rider arrived seeing him up close paran took an involuntary step back half the mans face had been burned away a patch covered the right eye and the man held his head at an odd angle the man flashed a ghastly grin then dismountedyoure the one huh he asked in a rasping voiceis it true about the bridgeburners paran demanded wiped outmore or less five squads left or thereabouts about forty in all his left eye squinted and he reached up to adjust his battered helmet didnt know where youd be heading before do now youre whiskeyjacks new captain huhsergeant whiskeyjack is known to you paran scowled this claw wasnt like the others whatever thinking they did about him they kept to themselves and he preferred it that waythe man climbed back into his saddle lets ride we can talk on the wayparan went to the other horse and tied his bag to the saddle which was of the seven cities style highbacked and with a hinged horn that folded forwardhed seen several like this on this continent it was a detail hed already filed away natives from the seven cities had a predisposition for making trouble and this whole genabackan campaign had been a foulup from the very start no coincidence that most of the nd th and th armies had been recruited from the seven cities subcontinenthe mounted and they settled into a steady canter across the plateauthe claw talked sergeant whiskeyjacks got a lot of followers around here acts like he dont know it you got to remember something thats been damn near forgotten back in malazwhiskeyjack once commanded his own companyparans head snapped around that fact had been thoroughly stripped from the annals as far as empire history was concerned it had never happened back in the days when dassern ultor ran the military the claw continued blithely it was whiskeyjacks seventh company that ran down the seven cities mage cabal out in the panpotsun wastes he ended the war then and there of course everything went to hell after that what with hood taking ultors daughter and not long after that when ultor died all his men were pulled down fast thats when the bureaucrats swallowed up the army damn jackals and theyve been sniping at each other ever since and to hell with the campaigns the claw sat forward pushing the saddlehorn down and spat past his horses left earparan shivered seeing that gesture in the old days it had announced the beginning of tribal war among the seven cities now it had become the symbol of the malaz nd army are you suggesting he cut in that the story youve just told me is commonplacenot in detail the claw admitted but some old veterans in the second fought with ultor not just in seven cities but as far back as falarparan thought for a time the man riding beside him though a claw was also nd army and hed been through a lot with them it made for an interesting perspective he glanced at the man and saw him grinningwhats so funnythe man shrugged the bridgeburners are a little hot these days theyre getting chaff for recruits and that makes it look like theyre about to be disbanded you talk with whoever it is you talk with back in malaz you tell them theyd end up with a mutiny on their hands they start messing with the bridgeburners thats in every report i send but no one seems to listen to me his grin broadened maybe they think ive been turned or something ehparan shrugged you were called in to meet me werent youthe claw laughed youve really been out of touch havent youthey called me in because im the last active in the second and as for the fifth and sixthforget it broods tiste and could pick out a claw from a thousand paces none of them left either my own claw master was garotted two days backthats something else aint it you i inherited captain once we hit the city i send you on your way and thats probably the last well ever see of each other you deliver your mission details as captain of the ninth squad they either laugh in your face or they stick a knife in your eyeits even betting what theyll do too bad but there it isup ahead loomed the gates of paleone more thing the claw said his eyes on the merlons above the gate just a bone ill throw you in case oponns smiling on you the high mage tayschrenns running things here dujeks not happy especially considering what happened with moons spawn its a bad situation between them but the high mage is relying on his being in close and constant communication with the empress and thats whats keeping him on top a warning then dujeks soldiers will follow him anywhere and that goes for the fifth and sixth armies too whats been gathered here is a storm waiting to breakparan stared at the man topper had explained the situation but paran had dismissed the mans assessmentit had seemed too much like a scenario devised to justify the empress filling the gallows not a tangle i want to get involved in leave me to complete my single taski desire no more than thatks wi vwssea xtampwtvt uwn ve tverby tayschrenn just watched us arrive any chance he knows you captainno i hope not he added silentlyas they trotted into the city proper and a wall of sound rose to meet them parans eyes glazed slightly pale was a madhouse buildings on all sides gutted by fire the streets despite being cobbleheaved in places and dented in others were packed with people carts braying animals and marines he wondered if he should start measuring his life in minutestaking command of a squad that had gone through four captains in three years then delivering a mission that no sane soldier would consider coupled with a brewing firestorm of a largescale insurrection possibly headed by the empires finest military commander against a high mage who looked to be carving his own rather big niche in the worldall of this had paran feeling somewhat dismayedhe was jolted by a heavy slap on his back the claw had moved his horse close and now he leaned overout of your depth captain dont worry every damn person heres out of their depth some know it some dont its the ones who dont you got to worry about start with whats right in front of you and forget the rest for now itll show up in its own time find any marine and ask direction to the bridgeburners thats the easy partparan noddedthe claw hesitated then leaned closer ive been thinking captain its a hunch mind you but i think youre here to do some good no dont bother answering only if you get into trouble you get word to toc the younger thats me im in the messenger corps outrider class the second all rightparan nodded again thank you he said just as a loud crash sounded behind them followed by a chorus of angry voices neither rider turnedwhats that you said captainparan smiled better head off keep your coverin case something happens to me ill find myself a guide by the booksure thing captain toc the younger waved then swung his mount down a sidestreet moments later paran lost sight of him he drew a deep breath then cast his gaze about searching for a likely soldierparan knew that his early years in the noble courts of his homeland had prepared him well for the kind of deception adjunct lorn demanded of him in the past two years however he had begun to recognize more clearly what he was becoming that brash honest youth who had spoken with the empresss adjunct that day on the itko kanese coast now gnawed at him hed dropped right into lorns lap like a lump of unshaped clay and she had proceeded to do what she did bestwhat frightened paran most these days was that he had grown used to being used hed been someone else so many times that he saw a thousand faces heard a thousand voices all at war with his own when he thought of himself of that young nobleborn man with the overblown faith in honesty and integrity the vision that came to him now was of something cold hard and dark it hid in the deepest shadows of his mind and it watched no contemplation no judgement just icy clinical observationhe didnt think that that young man would see the light of day againhe would just shrink further back swallowed by darkness then disappear leaving no traceand paran wondered if he even cared any morehe marched into the barracks that had once housed pales noble guard one old veteran lounged on a nearby cot her ragwrapped feet jutting over the end the mattress had been stripped away and tossed into a corner the woman lay on the flat boards her hands behind her headparans gaze held on her briefly then travelled down the ward with the lone exception of the veteran marine the place was empty he returned his attention to her corporal is it the woman didnt move yeah what i take it he said drily that the chain of command has thoroughly disintegrated around hereher eyes opened and managed a lazy sweep of the officer standing before her probably she said then closed her eyes again you looking for somebody or whatim looking for the ninth squad corporalwhy they in trouble againparan smiled to himself are you the average bridgeburner corporalall the average ones are dead she saidwhos your commander paran askedantsy but hes not herei can see that the captain waited then sighed well where is this antsytry knobbs inn up the street the last i seen of him he was losing his shirt to hedge antsys a cardplayer right only not a good one she began picking at a tooth at the back of her mouthparans brows rose your commander gambles with his menantsys a sergeant the woman explained our captains dead anyway hedge is not in our squadoh and what squad is he withthe woman grinned swallowing whatever her finger had dislodgedthe ninthwhats your name corporalpicker whats yourscaptain paranpicker shot up into a sitting position her eyes wide oh youre the new captain whos yet to pull a sword ehparan grinned thats rightyou got any idea of the odds on you right now it doesnt look goodwhat do you meanshe smiled a broad smile the way i pick it she said leaning back down and closing her eyes again the first blood you see on your hands is gonna be your own captain paran go back to quon tali where its safe go on the empress needs her feet lickedtheyre clean enough paran said he was not sure how to deal with this situation part of him wanted to draw his sword and cut picker in halfanother wanted to laugh and that one had an edge of hysteria to itbehind him the outer door banged open and heavy footsteps sounded on the floorboards paran turned a redfaced sergeant his face dominated by an enormous handlebar moustache stormed into the room ignoring paran he strode up beside pickers cot and glowered down at herdammit picker you told me hedge was having a bad run and now that bowlegged turds cleaned me out hedge is having a bad run picker said but yours is worse you never asked me about that did you antsy meet captain paran the ninths new officerthe sergeant swung around and stared hoods breath he muttered then faced picker againim looking for whiskeyjack sergeant paran said softlysomething in the captains tone brought antsy around he opened his mouth then shut it when his eyes caught parans steady gaze some kid delivered a message whiskeyjack trooped out a few of his people are at knobbsthank you sergeant paran walked stiffly from the roomantsy let out a long breath and glanced at pickertwo days she pronounced then somebody does him old rockface has already laid twenty to thatampvsj   txpitsxlon xglrixtntamp simdvxngwtx ine trive  dt a ampamuel shameparan entered knobbs inn and stopped just inside the doorway the place was packed with soldiers their voices a jumbled roar only a few showed on their uniforms the flame emblem of the bridgeburners the rest were nd armyat a large table beneath an overhanging walkway that fronted rooms on the first floor half a dozen bridgeburners sat playing cards a wideshouldered man whose black hair was braided into a ponytail and knotted with charms and fetishes sat with his back to the room dealing out the cards with infinite patience even through the hightide roar paran could hear the mans monotone counting the others at the table deluged the dealer with curses to little effectbarghast paran murmured his gaze on the dealer only one in the bridgeburners thats the ninth then he took a deep breath then plunged into the crowdby the time he arrived behind the barghast his fine cloak was drenched with sour ale and bitter wine and sweat cast a shine on his forehead the barghast he saw had just finished the deal and was setting down the deck in the tables centre revealing as he did so the endless blue woad tattooing on his bared arm the spiral patterns marred here and there by white scarsis this the ninth paran asked loudlythe man opposite the barghast glanced up his weathered face the same colour as his leather cap then returned his attention to his cardsyou captain parani am and you soldierhedge he nodded at the heavy man seated to his right thats mallet the squads healer and the barghasts name is trotts and it aint because he likes jogging he jerked his head to his left the rest dont mattertheyre second army and lousy players to boot take a seat captain whiskeyjack and the rest been called out for the time being should be back soonparan found an empty chair and pulled it up between mallet and trottshedge growled hey trotts you gonna call this game or whatreleasing a long breath paran turned to mallet tell me healer whats the average life expectancy for an officer in the bridgeburnersa grunt escaped hedges lips before or after moons spawnmallets heavy brows rose slightly as he answered the captain maybe two campaigns depends on a lot of things balls aint enough but it helps and that means forgetting everything you learned and jumping into your sergeants lap like a babe you listen to him you might make ithedge thumped the table wake up trotts what are we playing herethe barghast scowled im thinking he rumbledparan leaned back and unhitched his belttrotts decided on a game to the groans of hedge mallet and the three nd army soldiers since it was the game trotts always decided onmallet spoke captain youve been hearing things about the bridgeburners rightparan nodded most officers are terrified of the bridgeburners word is the mortality rates so high because half the captains end up with a dagger in their backhe paused and was about to continue when he noticed the sudden silence the game had stopped and all eyes had fixed on him sweat broke out under parans clothing and from what ive seen so far he pressed on im likely to believe that rumour but ill tell you somethingall of youif i die with a knife in my back itd better be because i earned it otherwise i will be severely disappointed he hitched his belt and rose tell the sergeant ill be in the barracks id like to speak with him before were officially musteredhedge gave a slow nod will do captain the man hesitated uh captain care to sit in on the gameparan shook his head thanks no a grin tugged the corner of his mouth bad practice an officer taking his enlisted mens moneynow theres a challenge youd better back up some time hedge said his eyes brighteningill think about it paran replied as he left the table pushing through the crowd he felt a growing sense of something that caught him completely offguard insignificance a lot of arrogance had been drilled into him from his days as a boy among the nobility through to his time at the academy that arrogance now cowered in some corner of his brain shocked silent and numbhe had known that well before hed met the adjunct his path into and through the officer training corps of the marine academy had been an easy procession marked by winks and nods but the empires wars were fought here thousands of leagues away and here paran realized nobody cared one whit about court influences and mutually favourable deals those shortcuts swelled his chances of dying and dying fast if not for the adjunct hed have been totally unprepared to take commandparan grimaced as he pushed open the tavern door and stepped out into the street it was no wonder the old emperors armies had so easily devoured the feudal kingdoms in his path on the road to empire he was suddenly glad of the stains marring his uniformhe no longer looked out of placehe strode into the alley leading to the barracks side entrance the way lay in shadow beneath highwalled buildings and the faded canopies that hung over sagging balconies pale was a dying city he knew enough of its history to recognize the bleached tints of longlost glory true it had commanded enough power to forge an alliance with moons spawn but the captain suspected that that had had more to do with the moon lords sense of expedience than to any kind of mutual recognition of power the local gentry made much of finery and pomp but their props looked tired and worn he wondered how alike he and his kind were with these droopy citizens a sound behind him the faintest scuff made him turn a shadowwrapped figure closed on him paran cried out snatching at his swordan icy wind washed over him as the figure moved in the captain backpedalled seeing the glint of blades in each hand he twisted to one side his sword halfway out of the scabbard his attackers left hand darted up paran jerked his head back throwing his shoulder forward to block a blade that never arrived instead the long dagger slid like fire into his chest a second blade sank into his side even as blood gushed up inside to fill his mouth coughing and groaning paran reeled careened off a wall then slid down with one hand grasping futilely at the damp stones his fingernails gouging tracks through the moulda blackness closed around his thoughts which seemed to involve only a deep heartfelt regret faintly a ringing sound came to his ears as if something small and metallic was skittering across a hard surface the sound remained of something spinning and the darkness encroached no furthersloppy a man said in a thin voice i am surprised the accent was familiar pulling him to a childhood memory his father dealing with da honese tradersthe answer came from directly above paran keeping an eye on meanother accent he recognized kanese and the voice seemed to come from a girl or a child yet he knew it was the voice of his killercoincidence the other replied then giggled someonesomething i should sayhas entered our warren uninvited my hounds hunti dont believe in coincidencesagain came the giggle nor do i two years ago we began a game of our own a simple settling of old scores it seems we have stumbled into a wholly different game here in palewhosei shall have that answer soon enoughdont get distracted ammanas laseen remains our target and the collapse of the empire she rules but never earnedi have as always supreme confidence in you cotillioni must be getting back the girl said moving awayof course so this is the man lorn sent to find youi believe so this should draw her into the fray in any caseand this is desirable the conversation faded as the two speakers walked away leaving as the only sound in parans head that whiffing hum as if a coin was spinning endlessly spinningchapter fourthey were of a kind then the histories writ large in tattooed tracery the tales a tracking of old wounds but something glowed hard in their eyesthose flamegnawed arches that vanishing span they are their own past each in turn destined to fall in line on the quiet wayside beside the river they refuse to namethe bridgeburners ivitoc the younger b tattersail glared at whiskeyjack hairlock is insane she pronounced that edge to him was always there but hes chewed holes in his own warrens and hes tasting chaos worse yet its making him more powerful more dangerousthey had gathered in tattersails quarters which consisted of an outer roomwhere they now satand a bedroom with the rare luxury of a solid wood door the past occupants had hastily stripped the place of anything valuable and portable leaving behind only the larger pieces of furniture tattersail sat at the table along with whiskeyjack quick ben and kalam and the sapper named fiddler the air in the room had grown hot stiflingof course hes insane quick ben replied looking at his sergeant whose face remained impassive the wizard hastily added but thats to be expected feners tail lady hes got the body of a puppet of course thats twisted himhow twisted whiskeyjack asked his wizard hes supposed to be watching our backs isnt hekalam said quick ben got him under control hairlocks backtracking working through the mazehell find out who in the empire wants us deadthe danger quick ben added rounding on tattersail is his being amptecttamp vke xvted vz the regular paths are all tripwiredtattersail mulled over that point then nodded tayschrenn would find him or at least catch wind that someones sniffing around but hairlocks using the power of chaos the paths that lie between warrens and thats unhealthynot just for him but for all of uswhy all of us whiskeyjack askedquick ben answered it weakens the warrens frays the fabric which in turns allows hairlock to break into them at will and out again but we have no choice we have to give hairlock his rope for nowthe sorceress sighed massaging her brow tayschrenns the one youre looking for ive already told youthats not good enough quick ben cut in how many agents is he using what are the details of the planwhat the hell is the plan is all this on laseens orders or is the high mage eyeing the throne for himself we need to know dammitall right all right tattersail said so hairlock unravels the whole thing for youthen what do you intend to try to kill tayschrenn and everyone else involved are you counting on my help in that she looked from one face to the next each revealed nothing anger flared and she rose i know she said stiffly that tayschrenn probably murdered nkaronys nightchill and my cadre he probably knew your tunnels would collapse around you and he might well have decided that dujeks second was a threat that needed culling but if you think im going to help you without knowing what youre planning youre mistaken theres more to all this than youre willing to tell me if it was just your survival at stake why dont you just desert i doubt dujek would chase you downunless of course tayschrenns suspicions about onearm and the second are grounded in truthyouve plans for a mutiny proclaiming dujek emperor and marching off to genabaris she paused looking from one man to the next has tayschrenn simply anticipated you thereby fouling up your plans am i being pulled into a conspiracy if i am then i have to know its eventual goals i have that right dont iwhiskeyjack grunted then reached for the jug of wine standing on the table he refilled everyones cupquick ben let out a long breath then rubbed the back of his necktattersail he said quietly were not going to challenge tayschrenn directly that would be suicide no well cut away his support carefully with precision then we arrange his fall from grace assuming the empress is not involved but we need to know more we need those answers before we can decide our options you dont have to get any more involved than you already are in fact its safer that way hairlock wants you to protect his back failing every other option chances are that wont be necessary he looked up and gave her a strained smileleave tayschrenn to me and kalamall very well but you didnt answer me tattersail looked at the other blackskinned man her eyes narrowing you were a claw once werent youkalam shruggedi thought no one could leavealivehe shrugged againthe sapper fiddler growled something incomprehensible and rose from his chair he began pacing his bandied legs carrying him from one wall to the next like a fox in a pit no one paid him any further attentionwhiskeyjack handed a cup to tattersail stay with us in this sorceress quick ben doesnt usually foul things too badly he made a sour face i admit im not completely convinced either but ive learned to trust him you can take that for whatever its worthtattersail took a deep draught of wine she wiped her lips your squads heading to darujhistan tonight covert which means i wont be able to communicate with you if the situation turns badtayschrenn would detect the usual ways quick ben said hairlocks our only unbreachable linkyou reach us through him tattersailwhiskeyjack eyed the sorceress back to hairlock you dont trust himnothe sergeant fell silent his gaze fixed on the tabletop his impassive expression fell away revealing a war of emotionshe keeps his world bottled up but the pressures building she wondered what would happen when everything broke loose inside himthe two seven cities men waited eyes on their sergeant only fiddler continued his preoccupied pacing the sappers mismatched uniform still carried the stains of the tunnels someone elses blood had splashed thickly on the front of his tunicas if a friend had died in his arrns poorly healed blisters showed under the uneven bristle of his cheeks and jaw and his lank red hair hung haphazardly beneath his leather helmeta long minute passed then the sergeant nodded sharply to himselfhis hard eyes still fixed on the tabletop he said all right sorceress well give you this quick ben tell her about sorrytattersails brows rose she crossed her arms and faced the wizardquick ben looked none too pleased he shifted uneasily and cast a hopeful glance at kalam but the big man looked awaywhiskeyjack growled now wizardquick ben met tattersails steady gaze with an almost childlike expressionfear guilt and chagrin flitted across his fine features you remember hershe barked a harsh laugh not an easy one to forget an odd sense about her dangerous she thought about revealing what shed learned during her fatid with tayschrenn virgin of death but something held her back no she corrected herself not just somethingi still dont trust them you suspect shes in the service of someone elsethe wizards face was ashen he cleared his throat she was recruited two years ago in itko kan one of the usual sweeps across the empires heartlandkalams voice rumbled beside her something ugly happened there at around the same time its been buried pretty deep but the adjunct became involved and a claw came in her wake and silenced damn near everyone in the city guard who might have talked i made use of old sources scrounged up some odd detailsodd quick ben said and revealing if you know what youre looking fortattersail smiled to herself these two men had a way of talking in tandem she returned her attention to the wizard who continuedseems a company of cavalry hit some hard luck no survivors as for what they ran into it had something to do withdogs kalam finished without missing a beatthe sorceress frowned at the assassinput it together quick ben said drawing her attention once againadjunct lorn is laseens personal magekiller her arrival on the scene suggests sorcery was involved in the massacre high sorcery the wizards gaze narrowed on tattersail and he waitedshe swallowed another mouthful of wine the fatid showed me dogs and sorcery into her mind returned the image of the rope as she had seen it in the reading high house shadow ruled by shadowthrone and the rope and in their servicethe seven hounds of shadow she looked to whiskeyjack but the sergeants eyes remained downcast his expression blank as stonegood quick ben snapped somewhat impatiently the hound hunted thats our guess but its a good one the nineteenth regiment of the eighth cavalry were all killed even their horses a league worth of coastline settlements needed repopulatingfine tattersail sighed but what does this have to do with sorrythe wizard turned away and kalam spoke hairlocks going to follow more than just one trail sorceress were pretty sure sorry is somehow involved with house shadowit certainly seems tattersail said that since its arrival in the deck and the opening of its warren shadows path crosses the empires far too often to be accidental why should the warren between light and dark display such obsession with the malazan empirekalams gaze was veiled odd isnt it after all the warren only appeared following the emperors assassination at laseens hand shadowthrone and his companion the patron of assassinscotillion were unheard of before kellanved and dancers deaths it also seems that whatever disagreement there is between house shadow and empres laseen is uhm personaltattersail closed her eyes dammit its that obvious isnt it quick ben she said hasnt there always been an accessible warren of shadow rashan the warren of illusionsrashan is a false warren sorceress a shadow of what it claims to represent if youll excuse my wording it is itself an illusion the gods alone know where it came from or who created it in the first place or even why but the true warren of shadow has been closed inaccessible for millennia until the th year of burns sleep nine years ago the earliest writings of house shadow seemed to indicate that its throne was occupied by a tiste edurtiste edur tattersail interrupted who were theythe wizard shrugged cousins of the tiste and i dont know sorceressyou dont know actually it seems you know a hell of a lotquick ben shrugged to punctuate his last words then he added in any case we believe sorry is connected with house shadowwhiskeyjack startled everyone by surging to his feet im not convinced he said throwing quick ben a glare that told tattersail the had been countless arguments over this issue sorry likes killing and having her around is like having spiders down your shirt i know all that i can see it and feel it the same as any of you it doesnt mean shes some kind of demon he turned to face kalam she kills like you do kalam youve both got ice in your veins so what i look at you and i see a because thats what men are capable ofi dont hunt for excuses be i dont like to think that thats how nasty we can get we look at and we see reflections of ourselves hood take it if we dont like we seehe sat down just as abruptly as he had risen and reached for the jug when he continued his voice had dropped a notch that is my opinion anyway im no expert on demons but ive seen enough mortal men and women act like demons given the need my squads wizard is scared kss by a fifteenyearold girl my assassin slips a knife into his hand whenever shes within twenty paces of him he met tattersails eyes hairlock has two missions instead of one and if you think quick ben and kalam are correct in their suspicions you can walk from all thisi know how things go when gods step into the fray the lines around his mouth tightened momentarily a replaying of memories i know he whispered tattersail slowly let out her breath which she had been holding the sergeant first rose to his feet his needs were clear to her now he wanted sorry to be just human just a girl twisted hard by a hard war because that was something he understood something he could withback in seven cities she said quietly the story goes that emperors first swordhis commander of his armiesdassern had accepted a gods offer hood made dassern his knight of death then something happened something went wrong and dassern renounced the title swore a vow of vengeance against hoodagainst lord of death himself all at once other ascendants started med manipulating events it all culminated with dasserns murder the emperors assassination and blood in the streets temples at sorceries unleashed she paused seeing the memories of those reflected in whiskeyjacks face you were there and you dont want it to happen again here and now you think if you can deny that serves shadow your conviction will be enough to shape reality you to believe that to save your sanity because there are some things that you can go through only once oh whiskeyjack i cant ease burden you see i think quick ben and kalam are right if shadow claimed the girl the trail will be evidenthairlock will find itdo you walk away from this the sergeant askedtattersail smiled the only death i fear is dying ignorant no answelbrave words woman these people have a way of bringing the bestor maybe the worstin mesomething glittered in whiskeyjacks eyes and he nodded so that he said gruffly he leaned back whats on your mind fiddler he asked the sapper who was still pacing behind himgot a bad feeling the man muttered somethings wrong not her though but close by its just he stopped cocking his head then sighed resuming his uneasy walk not sure not suretattersails eyes followed the wiry little man a natural talent something working on pure instinct very rare i think you should listen to him she saidwhiskeyjack gave her a pained lookkalam grinned a network of fines crinkling around his dark eyes fiddler saved our lives in the tunnel he explained one of his bad feelingstattersail leaned back in her chair and crossed her arms she asked s where is sorry right nowfiddler whirled his eyes widening on the sorceress his mouth opened then snapped shut againthe other three surged to their feet chairs toppling backwardsweve got to get going fiddler grated theres a knife out there and its got blood on itwhiskeyjack checked his longsword kalam out front twenty paces he faced tattersail as the assassin slipped out we lost her couple of hours ago happens a lot between missions his face look drawn there may be no connection with this bloodied knifea blossoming of power filled the room and tattersail spun to face quick ben the wizard had accessed his warren the sorcery bled strange swirling flavour that she could not recognize and it frightened her with its intensity she met the black mans shining eyes i should know you she whispered theres not enough true masters in this world for me to not know you who are you quick benwhiskeyjack interjected everyone readythe wizards only answer to tattersail was a shrug to whiskeyjack he said readythe sergeant strode to the door take care sorceressa moment later they were gone tattersail righted the chairs then refilled her goblet with wine high house shadow and a knife in dark a new games begun or the old ones just turnedparan opened his eyes to bright hot sunlight but the sky above him was wrong he saw no sun the yellow glare was sharp yet sourceless heat gusted down on him with oppressive weighta moaning sound filled the air not wind because there was no wind he tried to think tried to recall his last memories but the past was blank torn away and only fragments remained a ships cabin the thrust of his dagger as he flung it again and again against a wooden post a hand with rings hair of white grinning sardonicallyhe rolled to one side seeking the source of the moaning sound a dozen paces away on the flat plain that was neither grass nor earth rose an arched gateway leading to nothing ive seen such gates before none so large i think as this onenone looking quite like this this thing twisted upright yet from his position sideways the gate was not he realized made of stone bodies naked human figures carved likenesses no oh no the figures moved groaned slowly writhed in place flesh blackened as if stained with peat eyes closed and mouths open with faint endless moansparan climbed to his feet staggered as a wave of dizziness ran through him then fell once again to the groundsomething like indecision a voice said coollyblinking paran rolled on to his back above him stood a young man and womantwins the man wore loose silk clothing white and gold his thin face was pale expressionless his twin was wrapped in a shimmering purple cape her blonde hair casting reddish glintsit was the man whod spoken he smiled without humour down at paran weve long admired your his eyes widenedsword the woman finished a smirk in her tonefar more subtle than say a coin dont you think the mans smile turned mocking most he said swinging his head to study the ghastly edifice of the gate dont pause here its said there was a cult once in the habit of drowning victims in bogs i imagine hood finds them aesthetically pleasinghardly surprising the woman drawled that death has no tasteparan tried to sit up but his limbs refused the command he dropped his head back feeling the strange loam yield to its weight what has happened he raspedyou were murdered the man said lightlyparan closed his eyes why then have i not passed through hoods gate if that is what it iswere meddling the woman saidoponn the twins of chance and my sword my untested blade purchased years ago with a name i chose so capriciouslywhat does oponn want from meonly this stumbling ignorant thing you call your life dear boy the trouble with ascendants is that they try to rig every game of course we delight in uncertaintya distant howl stroked the airoops the man said come to make certain of things id say wed best leave sister sorry captain but it seems youll pass through that gate after allmaybe the woman saidher brother rounded on her we agreed no confrontation confrontations messy unpleasant i despise discomfiting scenes besides the ones who come dont play fairthen neither do we the sister snapped she turned to the gate raised her voice lord of death we would speak with you hoodparan rolled his head watched as a bent limping figure emerged fro the gate wearing rags the figure slowly approached paran squinted an old woman a child with drool on its chin a deformed young girl a stunted broken trell a desiccated tiste andoh make up your mind the sister saidthe apparition cocked a deaths head the grin of its teeth stained muddy yellow you have chosen it said in quavering voice unimaginativelyyou are not hood the brother scowledbones shifted under creaking skin the lord is busybusy we do not take kindly to insults the sister saidthe apparition cackled then stopped abruptly how unfortunate a mellifluous deepthroated laugh would be more to my liking ah well in answer nor does my lord appreciate your interruption of this natural passage of a soulmurdered at the hand of a god the sister said that makes him fair gamethe creature grunted shuffled close to look down at paran the eye sockets glimmered faintly as if old pearls hid within the shadows what oponn it asked as it studied paran do you wish of my lordnothing from me the brother said turning awaysistereven for the gods she replied death awaits an uncertainty hiding deep within them she paused make them uncertainthe creature cackled again and again cut it short reciprocityof course the sister responded ill look for another a death premature meaningless eventhe apparition was silent then the head creaked in a nod in this mortals shadow of courseagreedmy shadow paran asked what does that mean preciselymuch sorrow alas the apparition said someone close to you shall walk through deaths gates in your placeno take me instead i beg of yoube quiet snapped the apparition pathos makes me illthe howl reverberated again much closer this timewed best leave the brother saidthe apparition opened its jaws as if to laugh then clacked them shutno it muttered not again it hobbled back to the gate pausing once to turn back and wavethe sister rolled her eyestime to leave the brother repeated uneasilyyes yes his sister said eyeing paranthe captain sighed looking away no final riddles if you pleasewhen he looked back oponn was gone once again he tried to sit uponce again he faileda new presence arrived filling the air with tension a smell of threatsighing paran craned his head around he saw a pair of houndsmassive hulking creatures dark tongues lolling as they sat watching him these are what killed the company in itko kan these are the cursed horrifying beasts both hounds froze heads hunching towards him as if seeing the hatred in his eyes paran felt his heart go cold at their avid attention he was slow to realize he had bared his teetha stain of shadow separated the two hounds the stain vaguely manshaped and translucent the shadow spoke the one lorn sent i would have thought someone of ability though it must be said you died wellevidently not paran saidah yes the shadow said and so it falls to me to complete the taskbusy hours theseparan thought of oponns conversation with hoods servantuncertainty if a god fears anything the day you die shadowthrone he said quietly i will be waiting for you on the other side of that gate with a smile gods can die cant theysomething crackled in the portalway of the gate shadowthrone and the hounds flinchedparan continued wondering at his own courage to bait these ascendants always despised authority didnt they halfway between life and deaththis promise costs me nothing you seeliar the only warren that can touch you now isdeath paran said of course he added someone else interceded and was certain to leave long before you and your tooloud hounds arrivedthe king of high house shadow edged forward who what does it plan who opposes usfind your own answers shadowthrone you do understand dont you that if you send me on my way now your opposition will seek other means knowing nothing of who their next tool is how will you sniff out their next move youll be left darting at shadowseasier to follow you the god conceded i must speak with my companionas you like paran interrupted i wish i could standthe god rasped laughter if you stand you walk one way only you have a reprieveand if hood comes to gather you to your feet the guiding hand is his not ours excellent and if you live so shall my shadow follow youparan grunted my shadows a crowded place these days his eyes fell once again on the hounds the creatures watched him still their eyes faint coals ill have you yet as if fanned by his silent promise the red glows sharpenedthe god resumed speaking but the world had darkened around paran fading dwindling until the voice was gone and with it all awareness but the faint renewed spinning of a coinan unknown span of time passed in which paran wandered through memories he had thought long losthis days as a child clinging to his mothers dress and taking his first tottering steps the nights of storm when he raced down the chill hallway to his parents bedroom tiny feet slapping on the cold stone holding the hands of his two sisters as they stood waiting on the hard cobbles of the courtyardwaiting waiting for someone the images seemed to lurch sideways in his head his mothers dress no an old woman in the service of the household not his parents bedroom but those of the servants and there in the courtyard with his sisters theyd stood half the morning awaiting the arrival of their mother and father two people they barely knewin his mind scenes replayed themselves moments of mysterious import hidden significance pieces of a puzzle he couldnt recognize shaped by hands not his own and with a purpose he couldnt fathoma tremor of fear travelled the length of his thoughts as he sensed that somethingsomeonewas busy reordering the formative events of his life turning them on end and casting them into the present new shadows somehow the guiding hand played with him with his lifeit seemed an odd kind of death voices reached himaw hell a face bent close to parans own looked into his open blank eyes the face was pickers he didnt stand a chance she said sergeant antsy spoke from a few feet away nobody in the ninth wouldve done him like this he said not right here in the citypicker reached out and touched the chest wound her fingers surprisingly soft on his torn flesh this isnt kalams workyou all right here antsy asked im going to get hedge and mallet and whoever else has shown upgo ahead picker replied seeking and finding the second wound eight inches below the first this one came later righthanded and weaka very odd death indeed paran thought what held him here had there been another place a place of heat searing yellow light and voices figures faint indistinct there beneath the arch of of crowds strangely held in place eyes closed mouths open a chorus of the dead had he gone somewhere only to return to these real voices these real hands on his flesh how could he see through the empty glass of his eyes or feel the womans gentle touch on his body and what of the pain rising as from a great depth like a leviathanpicker withdrew her hands and rested her elbows on her thighs as she crouched before paran now how come youre still bleeding captain those knife wounds are at least an hour oldthe pain reached the surface paran felt his gummy lips split the hinges of his jaw cracked and he drew in a savage gasp then screamedpicker bolted backwards her sword appearing in her hand as if from nowhere as she backed to the alleys far wall shedenuls mercyboots pounded on the cobbles off to her right and her head whipped around healer the bastards alivethe third bell after midnight tolled sonorously through the city of pale echoing down streets emptied by the curfew a light rain had begun casting the night sky with a murky gold hue in front of the large rambling estate two blocks from the old palace that had become part of the nds quarters two marines wrapped in black raincapes stood guard outside the main gatedamned miserable night aint it one said shiveringthe other shifted his pike to his left shoulder and hawked a mouthful of phlegm into the gutter you just guessing mind he said wagging his head any other brilliant insights you feel ready to toss my way you just speak up hearwhat did i do the first man demanded hurtthe second soldier stiffened hush someone coming up the streetthe guard waited tensely hands on their weapons a figure crossed from the opposite side and stepped into the torchlighthalt the second guard growled advance slowly and youd better have business herethe man took a step closer kalam bridgeburners the ninth he said quietlythe marines remained wary but the bridgeburner kept his distance his dark face glistening in the rain whats your business here the second guard askedkalam grunted and glanced back down the street we didnt expect to be coming back as for our business well its better that tayschrenn dont know about it you with me soldierthe marine grinned and spat a second time into the gutter kalamyoud be whiskeyjacks corporal there was a new tone of respect in his voice whatever you want youve gotdamned right the other soldier growled i was at nathilog sir you want us blinded by the rain for the next hour or so you just say the wordwere bringing in a body kalam said but this never happened on your shifthoods gate no the second marine said peaceful as the seventh dawnfrom down the street came the sounds of a number of men approaching kalam waved them forward then slipped inside as the first guard unlocked the gate what do you figure theyre up to he asked after kalam had disappearedthe other shrugged hope itll stick something hard and sharp up tayschrenn hood take the treacherous murderer and knowing them bridgeburners thats exactly what theyll do he fell silent as the group arrived two men carried a third man between them the second soldiers eyes widened as he saw the rank of the unconscious man and the blood staining the front of his baldric oponns luck he hissed to the bridgeburner nearest him a man wearing a tarnished leather capthe pull not the push he addedthe bridgeburner threw him a sharp look you see a woman come after us you get out of her way you hear mea woman whoshes in the ninth and she might be thirsty for blood the man replied as he and his comrade dragged the captain through the gateforget security he said over his shoulder just stay alive if you canthe two marines stared at each other after the men had passed after a moment the first soldier reached to close the gate the other man stopped himleave it open he muttered lets find some shadows close but not too closehell of a night the first marine saidyou got a thing about stating the obvious havent you the other said as he moved away from the gatethe first man shrugged helplessly then hurried to followtattersail stared long and hard at the card centred on the field she had laid down she had chosen a spiral pattern working her way through the entire deck of dragons and arriving with a final card which could mark either an apex or an epiphany depending on how it placed itselfthe spiral had become a pit a tunnel downward and at its root seeming distant and shadowhazed waited the image of a hound she sensed an immediacy to this reading high house shadow had become involved a challenge to oponns command of the game her eyes were drawn to the first card she had placed at the spirals very beginning the mason of high house death held a minor position among the overall rankings but now the figure etched on the wood seemed to have risen to an eminent placing brother to the soldier of the same house the masons image was that of a lean greying man clothed in faded leathershis massive veinroped hands held stonecutting tools and around him rose roughly dressed menhirs tattersail found she could make out faint glyphs on the stones a language unfamiliar to her but reminiscent of seven cities script in the house of death the mason was the builder of barrows the placer of stones a promise of death not to one or a few but to many the language on the menhirs delivered a message not intended for her the mason had carved those words for himself and time had worn the edgeseven the man himself appeared starkly weathered his face latticed with cracks his silvered beard thin and tangled the role had been assumed by a man whod once worked in stone but no longerthe sorceress was having difficulty understanding this field the patterns she saw startled her it was as if a whole new game had begun with players stepping on to the scene at every turn midway through the spiral was high house darks knight its placement counterpoint to both the beginning and the end as with the last time the deck had unveiled this draconian figure something hovered in the inky sky behind the knight as elusive as ever at times seeming like a dark stain on her own eyesthe knights sword reached a black smoky streak towards the hound at the spirals apex and in this instance she knew its meaning the future held a clash between the knight and high house shadow the thought both frightened tattersail and left her feeling relievedit would be a confrontation there would be no alliance between the houses it was a rare thing to see such a clear and direct link between two houses the potential for devastation left her cold with worry blood spilled on such a high level of power cast aftershocks down through the worldinevitably people would be hurt and this thought brought her round back to the mason of high house death tattersails heart thudded heavy in her chest she blinked sweat from her eyes and managed a few deep breathsblood she murmured ever flows downward the masons shaping a barrowafter all he is deaths servantand he will touch me directlythat barrow is it mine do i back out abandon the bridgeburners to their fate flee from tayschrenn from the empirean ancient memory flooded her thoughts which she had repressed for almost two centuries the image shook her once again she walked the muddy streets of the village where she had been born a child bearing the talent a child who had seen the horsemen of war sweeping down into their sheltered lives a child who had run away from the knowledge telling no one and the night came a night of screams and deathguilt rose within her its spectre visage hauntingly familiar after all these years its face still held the power to shatter her world making hollow those things she needed solid rattling her illusion of security with a shame almost two hundred years oldthe image sank once again into its viscid pool but it left her changedthere would be no running away this time her eyes returned one last time to the hound the beasts eyes seemed to burn with yellow fire boring into her as if seeking to brand her soulshe stiffened in her chair as a cold presence washed over her from behind slowly tattersail turnedsorry for not giving you warning quick ben said emerging from the swirling cloud of his warren it held a strange spicy scent companys coming he said seeming distracted ive called hairlock he comes by warrentattersail shivered as a wave of premonition brushed her spine she faced the deck again and began to collect the cardsthe situations just become a lot more complicated the wizard said behind herthe sorceress paused giving herself a small tight smile really she murmuredthe wind flung rain against whiskeyjacks face faintly through the dark night the fourth bell clanged the sergeant pulled his raincape tighter and wearily shifted his stance the view from the rooftop of the palaces east turret was mostly obscured by sheets of rain youve been chewing on something for days he said to the man beside him lets hear it soldierfiddler wiped the rain from his eyes and squinted into the east not much to tell you sarge he said gruffly just feelings that sorceress for onetattersailyeah metal clinked as the sapper unstrapped his sword belt hate this damned thing he mutteredwhiskeyjack watched as the man tossed the belt and scabbarded shortsword to the rooftops pebbled surface behind them just dont forget it like you did last time the sergeant said hiding a grinfiddler winced make one mistake and nobody lets you forget itwhiskeyjack made no reply though his shoulders shook with laughterhoods bones fiddler went on i aint no fighter not like that anyway was born in an alley in malaz city learned the stonecutting trade breaking into barrows up on the plain behind mocks hold he glanced up at his sergeant you used to be a stonecutter too just like me only im no fast learner in soldiering like you was it was the ranks or the mines for mesometimes i think i went and made the wrong choicewhiskeyjacks amusement died as a pang followed fiddlers wordslearn what he wondered how to kill people how to send them off to die in some foreign land whats your feeling on tattersail the sergeant asked curtlyscared the sapper responded shes got some old demons riding her is my guess and theyre closing inwhiskeyjack grunted its rare youll find a mage with a pleasant past he said story goes she wasnt recruited she was on the run then she messed up with her first postingits bad timing her going all soft on us nowshes lost her cadre shes been betrayed without the empire whats she got to hold on to what has any of us gotits like shes ready to cry right on the edge every single minute im thinking shes lost her backbone sarge if tayschrenn puts her under his thumb shes liable to squeali think youve underestimated the sorceress fiddler whiskeyjack said shes a survivorand loyal its not common news but shes been offered the title of high mage more than once and she wont accept it doesnt show but a headtohead between her and tayschrenn would be a close thing shes a master of her warren and you dont acquire that with a weak spinefiddler whistled softly leaned his arms on the parapet i stand correctedanything else sapperjust one fiddler replied deadpanwhiskeyjack stiffened he knew what that tone implied go onsomethings about to be unleashed tonight sergeant fiddler swung round his eyes glittering in the darkness its going to be messyboth men turned at the thumping of the roofs trapdoor high fist dujek onearm emerged the light from the room below a broken beacon rising around him he cleared the ladders last rung and stepped on to the roof give me a hand with this damn door here he called to the two menthey strode over their boots crunching on the gravel scatter any word on captain paran high fist whiskeyjack asked as fiddler crouched over the trapdoor and with a grunt levered it back into placenone dujek said hes disappeared then again so has that killer of yours kalamwhiskeyjack shook his head i know where he is and where hes been all night hedge and mallet were the last to see the captain leaving knobs inn and then he just seems to vanish high fist we didnt kill this captain parandont quibble with words dujek muttered damn it fiddler is that your sword lying over there in a puddlebreath hissed between fiddlers teeth and he hurried over to the weaponthe mans a hopeless legend dujek said shedenul bless his hide he paused seeming to reorder his thoughts ok perish the thought then you didnt kill paran so where is hewere looking whiskeyjack said tonelesslythe high fist sighed all right understood you want to know who else might be wanting paran dead and that means explaining who sent him well hes adjunct lorns man has been for some time hes not claw though hes a bloody nobles son from untafiddler had donned his weapon and now stood twenty paces away at the roofs edge hands on his hips a good man theyre all good dammit whiskeyjack blinked the rain from his eyes from the capital could be someone in those circles nobody likes the old noble families not even the nobles themselvesits possible dujek conceded without much conviction in any case hes to command your squad and not for just this mission the assignments permanentwhiskeyjack asked is the darujhistan infiltration his own ideathe high fist replied no but whose it is is anybodys guess maybe the adjunct maybe the empress herself so what all that means is were sending you in anyway he scowled briefly im to relay the final details to you he faced the sergeant assuming paran is gone for goodmay i speak freely high fistdujek barked a laugh you think i dont know it whiskeyjack the plan stinks a tactical nightmarei dont agreewhati think it will do just as it was intended to do the sergeant said dully his gaze at first on the lightening eastern horizon then on the soldier standing at the roofs edge because it is intended to get us all killedthe high fist studied the sergeants face then he said come with me he led whiskeyjack over to where fiddler stood the sapper gave them a nod a moment later all three stood looking down on the citypales illlit streets wound between the rough blocks of buildings that seemed unwilling to yield the night behind curtains of rain their squatting silhouettes appeared to shiver before the coming dawnafter a while dujek said quietly danmed lonely out here isnt itfiddler grunted that it is sirwhiskeyjack closed his eyes whatever was happening thousands of leagues away was being played out here such was empire and it always would be no matter the place or the people they were all instruments blind to the hands shaping them the sergeant had faced that truth long ago it had galled him then and it galled him now the only relief these days seemed to come with exhaustiontheres pressure the high fist continued slowly to disband the bridgeburners ive already received the order to merge the second with the fifth and sixth well stand as the fifth near full complement the tides are bringing new waters to our shore gentlemen and they smell bitter he hesitated then said if you and your squad come out of darujhistan alive sergeant you have my permission just to walkwhiskeyjacks head snapped around and fiddler stiffeneddujek nodded you heard me and as for the rest of the bridgeburners well rest easy that ill take care of them the high fist glanced eastward baring his teeth in a humourless grin theyre pushing me but theres no way in hell theyre going to leave me with no room to manoeuvre ive got ten thousand soldiers i owe a lot toexcuse me sir fiddler cut in theres ten thousand soldiers saying theyre the ones owing you say the word andquiet dujek warnedyes sirwhiskeyjack remained silent his thoughts a whirling maelstromdesertion that word rang in his head like a dirge and fiddlers assertion was he felt a true one if high fist dujek decided it was time to make a move the last place whiskeyjack wanted to be was on the run hundreds of leagues away from the centre of things he was too close to dujek and though they strove to hide it the history between them ever churned beneath the surface thered been a time when dujek had called him sir and though whiskeyjack held no grudges he knew that dujek still had trouble accepting the change of fortunes if the time came whiskeyjack intended to be at onearms sidehigh fist he said at last aware that both men had been waiting for him to speak theres still a few bridgeburners left fewer hands on the sword but the swords still sharp its not our style to make life easy for those who oppose uswhoever they happen to be to just quietly walk away the sergeant sighed well thatd suit them wouldnt it while theres a hand on the sword a single hand the bridgeburners wont back down it settles on honour i guessi hear you dujek said then he grunted well here they comewhiskeyjack looked up followed the high fists gaze into the eastern skyquick ben cocked his head then hissed through his teeth the hounds have caught his trail he saidkalam cursed vehemently surging to his feetsitting on the bed tattersail frowned blearyeyed at the bearish man as he paced his footsteps on the floorboards barely raising a creakbig as he was kalam seemed to glide giving the scene an almost surreal feel with the wizard crosslegged and hovering a few inches off the wooden floor in the rooms centretattersail realized she was exhausted too much was happening and it was happening all at once she shook herself mentally and returned her attention to quick benthe wizard was linked to hairlock and the marionette had been on someonessomethingstrail which led down into the warren of shadow hairlock had reached the very gates of the shadow realm and then he had gone beyondfor a time quick ben had lost contact with the puppet and those long minutes of silence had left everyones nerves in tatters when hairlocks presence returned to the wizard he no longer moved alonehes coming out quick ben announced shifting warrens with oponns luck hell lose the houndstattersail winced at the wizards casual use of the fools name with so many currents swirling so close beneath the surface it might well call unwelcome attention to themweariness hung heavy in the room like bitter incense redolent with sweat and tension after his last words quick ben had bowed his headtattersail knew his mind now travelled the warrens clinging to hairlocks shoulder with an unbreakable gripkalams pacing brought him before the sorceress he stopped and faced her what about tayschrenn he asked gruffly his hands twitchinghe knows something has happened hes hunting but the quarry eludes him she smiled up at the assassin i feel him moving cautiously very cautiously for all he knows the quarry might be a rabbit or a wolfkalams expression remained grim or a hound he muttered then resumed his pacingtattersail stared at him was this what hairlock was doing drawing a hound after him were they all leading tayschrerm into a deadly ambush i trust not she said her eyes hardening on the assassin that would be foolishkalam ignored her pointedly avoiding her gazetattersail rose not foolish insane do you realize what could be unleashed here some believe the hounds are more ancient than the shadow realm itself but its not just thempower draws power if one ascendant parts the fabric here and now others will come smelling blood come the dawn every mortal in this city could be deadeasy lady kalam said nobody wants a hound loosed in the city i spoke from fear he still would not look at herthe assassins admission startled tattersail it was shame that kept his eyes from her fear was an admission of weakness for hoods sake she sighed ive been sitting on a pillow for the past two hoursthat caught him he stopped faced her then laughedit was a deep smooth laugh and it pleased her immenselythe bedroom door opened and mallet entered the room his round face shiny and flushed the healer glanced briefly at quick ben then walked to tattersail where he crouched down in front of her by all rights he said quietly captain paran should be in an officers hole with five feet of mud on his pretty face he nodded to kalam who had joined them the first wound was fatal up under his heart a professional thrust he added with a meaningful look at the assassin the second would have done him more slowly but no less certainkalam grimaced so he should be dead he isnt which meansintervention tattersail answered a queasy feeling settling in her stomach her heavylidded gaze fixed on mallet your denul skills proved sufficientthe healer quirked a smile it was easy i had help he explained the wounds were already closing the damage already mended i quickened it some but thats all theres been a deep trauma both body and mind by all rights it should be weeks before he recovers physically and that alone could be a problemwhat do you mean tattersail askedkalam strode to the table retrieved a jug of wine and three clay cupshe rejoined them and began pouring as mallet said healing should never be separated between the flesh and the sense of the flesh its hard to explain the denul warrens involve every aspect of healing since damage when it occurs does so on all levels shock is the scar that bridges the gap between the body and the mindall and well kalam growled handing the healer a cup what about paranmallet took a long draught and wiped at his mouth whatever force interceded cared for nothing but healing the flesh he may well be on his feet in a day or two but the shock needs time to healyou couldnt do it tattersail askedhe shook his head all such things are intertwined whatever interceded severed those connections how many shocks traumatic events has paran received in his lifetime which scar am i to trace i may well do more damage in my ignorancetattersail thought about the young man they had dragged into her room an hour earlier after his scream in the alley announcing to picker that he still lived he had fallen into unconsciousness all that she knew of paran was that he was a nobles son that hed come from unta and that he was the squads new officer on their mission in darujhistanin any case mallet said draining his cup hedge is keeping an eye on him he may come to any minute but theres no telling what state his mind will be in the healer grinned at kalam hedge has taken a liking to the brat his grin broadened as the assassin cursedtattersail raised an eyebrowseeing her expression mallet explained hedge also adopts stray dogsand other uh needy creatures he glanced at kalam who had resumed pacing and he can get stubborn about it toothe corporal growled wordlesslytattersail smiled the smile faded as her thoughts returned to captain paran hes going to be used she pronounced flatly like a swordmallet sobered with her words theres nothing of mercy in the healing only calculationquick bens voice startled them all the attempt on his life came from shadowthere was silence in the roomtattersail sighed before it had been just a suspicion she saw mallet and kalam exchange glances and guessed at what passed between themwherever sorry was when she returned to the fold there would be some hard questions and tattersail now knewwith certaintythat the girl belonged to shadowand that means quick ben resumed blithely that whoever interceded on parans behalf is now in direct opposition with the realm of shadow his head turned dark eyes fixing on the sorceress well need to know what paran knows whenever he comes around onlywe wont be here kalam finishedas if hairlock wasnt enough tattersail muttered now you want me nursing this captain of yoursquick ben rose brushing the dust from his leather leggings hairlock will be gone for some time those hounds are stubborn it may be a while before he can shake them or if the worst comes to the worst the wizard grinned darkly hell turn on them and give the shadow lord something to think aboutkalain said to mallet gather up hedge weve got to movequick bens last comment left tattersail cold she grimaced at the ashen taste in her mouth and watched in silence as the squad prepared to leave they had a mission ahead of them one that would take them right into the heart of darujhistan that city was the next on the empires list the last free city the continents lone gem worthy enough to covet the squad would infiltrate prepare the way theyd be entirely on their own in a strange way tattersail almost envied the isolation they were about to enter almost but not quite she feared they would all diethe masons barrow returned to her thoughts as if raised by her own fears it was she realized big enough to hold them allwith dawn a bladethin crimson streak at their backs the black moranth crouching on the high saddles of their quorl mounts glittered like diamonds slick with blood whiskeyjack fiddler and the high fist watched the dozen fliers approach overhead the rain had lessened and around the nearby rooftops smudges of grey mist sank down to scuff stone and tilewheres your squad sergeant dujek askedwhiskeylack nodded at fiddler who turned and headed back to the trapdoor theyll be here the sergeant answeredthe sparkling skinthin wings of the quorl four to each creature seemed to flip for the briefest of moments and as one the twelve moranth descended towards the turrets rooftop the sharp whirring sound of the wings was punctuated by the clicked commands of the moranth riders as they called out to each other they swept over the heads of the two men with a bare five feet to spare and without ceremony landed behind themfiddler had disappeared into the room below dujek his hand on his hip glared at the moranth for a moment before grumbling something inaudible and making his way to the trapdoorwhiskeyjack walked up to the nearest moranth a black chitin visor covered the soldiers face and it turned towards the sergeant in silent regard there was one among you whiskeyjack said onehanded he was five times marked for valour does he still livethe black moranth did not replythe sergeant shrugged and turned his attention to the quorls though he had ridden their backs before they continued to fascinate him the winged creatures balanced on four thin legs emerging from beneath the saddles they waited on the rooftop with wings splayed out and quivering fast enough to create a haze of water droplets suspended around them their long oddly segmented tails jutted straight out behind them multihued and twenty feet in length whiskeyjacks nostrils twitched as the now familiar acrid scent reached him the nearest quorls enormous wedgeshaped head was dominated by faceted eyes and articulating mandibles two additional limbsarms he supposedwere tucked underneath as he stared the quorls head swivelled until its left eye faced him squarelythe sergeant continued staring wondering what the quorl was seeing wondering what it was thinkingif it thought at all curious he gave the quorl a nodthe head cocked then turned away whiskeyjacks eyes widened to see the tip of the quorls tail curl up briefly it was the first time he had seen such a motionthe alliance between the moranth and the empire had changed the face of imperial war the malazan tactics here on genabackis had twisted into a new shape one increasingly dependent on transport by air of both soldiers and supplies such dependency was dangerous as far as whiskeyjack was concerned we know so little about these moranthno one has ever seen their cities in the forest i cant even tell their sexmost scholars held that they were true humans but there was no way to tellthe moranth collected their own dead from the battlefields there would be trouble in the empire if the moranth ever exercised a thirst for power from what he had heard however the various colour actions among them marked an everchanging hierarchy and the rivalry and competition remained at a fanatical pitchhigh fist dujek marched back to whiskeyjacks side his hard expression softened slightly with relief from the trapdoor voices rose in argument theyve arrived dujek said giving your new recruit an earful about somethingand dont tell me what because i dont want to knowwhiskeyjacks momentary relief was shattered by what he only now realized was the secret hope that sorry had deserted so his men had found her after all or she had found them either way his veterans did not sound happy to see her he couldnt blame them aa she tried to kill paran that seemed to be the suspicion of quick ben and kalamkalam was doing most of the bellowing putting more into his role as corporal than was warranted and dujeks searching glance at whiskeyjack was enough to push him towards the trapdoor he came to the edge and glared down into the room below everyone was there standing in a menacing circle around sorry who leaned against the ladder as if bored by the whole proceedingsquiet whiskeyjack roared down check your supplies and get up here now he watched them scamper then gave a satisfied nod and returned to where the high fist waiteddujek was rubbing the stump of his left arm frowning distractedlydamn this weather he mutteredmallet could ease that whiskeyjack saidnot necessary dujek replied im just getting old he scratched his jaw all of your heavy supplies have been delivered to the drop point ready to fly sergeantwhiskeyjack eyed the ridged second saddles on the quorl where they rose up at the back of the thorax like cowls then nodded sharplythey watched as the squad members emerged from the square doorway each wearing a raincape and burdened with a heavy pack fiddler and hedge were engaged in a whispering argument the latter casting a glare back at trotts whod trodden on his heel the barghast had attached his entire collection of charms trinkets and trophies to various parts of his burly body looking like a bedecked leadwood tree during the kanese fampe of the scorpions barghast were known for their odd sense of humour quvampen wab mtn waiting quorls her satchel was no bigger than a bedroll and the raincape she wore was more like a cloaknot standard issuereaching down to her ankles shed raised the hood despite the dawns burgeoning light her face remained in shadow this is all i have left whiskeyjack sigheddujek asked quietly how is she doing sergeantstill breathing whiskeyjack replied stonilythe high fist slowly shook his head so damn young these days a memory returned to whiskeyjack as he considered dujeks wordson a brief attachment to the th away from the siege at pale in the midst of the mott campaign sorry had joined them from the new troops arriving at nathilog hed watched her put a knife to three local mercenaries theyd taken prisoner in greydogostensibly to glean information but he recalled with a shudder it had been nothing like that not an act of expedience he had stared aghast horrified as sorry set to work on their loins he remembered meeting kalams gaze and the desperate gesture that sent the black man surging forward knives bared kalam had pushed past sorry and with three quick motions had laid open the mens throats and then came the moment that still twisted whiskeyjacks heart in their last frothing words the mercenaries had blessed kalamsorry had merely sheathed her weapon then walked awaythough the woman had been with the squad for two years still his men called her a recruit and they would probably do so until the day they died there was a meaning there and whiskeyjack understood it well recruits were not bridgeburners the stripping away of that label was an earned thing a recognition brought by deeds sorry was a recruit because the thought of having her inextricably enfolded within the bridgeburners burned like a hot knife in the throat of everyone in his squad and that was something to which the sergeant himself was not immuneas all of this flashed through whiskeyjacks thoughts his usually impassive expression failed him in his head he replied young no you can forgive the young you can answer their simple needs and you can look in their eyes and find enough there that is recognizable but herno best to avoid those eyes in which there was nothing that was youngnothing at alllets get you moving dujek growled mount everyone up the high fist turned to say a few last words to the sergeant but what he saw in whiskeyjacks face killed those words in his throattwo muted thunderclaps sounded in the city as the east spread its crimson cloak skyward the first report followed scant minutes later by the second the last of the nights tears churned down gunnels and swirled along street gutters muddy puddles filled potholes reflecting the thinning clouds overhead with an opaque cast among the narrow crooked alleys of pales krael quarter the chill and damp of the night clung to the dark spaces with tenacity here the mouldladen bricks and worn cobbles had swallowed the second thunderclap leaving no echo to challenge the patter of water droplets down one aisle winding south along the outer wall loped a dog the size of a mule its massive head was slung low forward in front of the broad bunched muscles of its shoulders that it had seen a night without rain was marked by its dusty dry mottled grey and black furthe animals muzzle was speckled with grey and its eyes glowed amberthe hound marked seventh among shadowthrones servants and called gear hunted the quarry was elusive cunning and swift in its flight yet gear felt close he knew that it was no human he trackedno mortal man or woman could have escaped his jaws for so long even more astonishing gear had yet to catch a glimpse of the quarry but it had trespassed with impunity it had entered the shadow realm trailing shadowthrone himself and strumming all the webs gears lord had spunthe only answer to such an affront was deathsoon the hound knew he would be the hunted one and if those hunters came in numbers and in strength gear would be hard pressed to continue his search there were those within the city who had felt the savage partings of the fabric and less than a minute after passing through the warrens gate gears hackles had stiffened telling him of nearby magics burgeoning thus far the hound had eluded detection but that would not lasthe moved silent and cautiously through the maze of shanties and leantos crouching against the city wall ignoring the occasional denizen come out to taste the dawns raincleansed air he stepped over the beggars sprawled in his path local dogs and ratters gave him one glance then slunk away ears flattened and tail sweeping the muddy groundas gear rounded the corner of a sunken stone house the morning breeze brought his head round he paused eyes searching down the street opposite him mist drifted here and there and the first carts of the lesser merchants were being pulled out by figures wrapped warm against the chillthe hound was running out of timegears eyes travelled down the length of the street focusing on a large walled estate at the far end four soldiers lounged before its gate watching passersby with little interest and talking among themselves gears head lifted his study finding a shuttered window on the estates second flooranticipation and pleasure surged through the hound he had found the trails end lowering his head again he moved his gaze unwavering on the four guardsthe shift had ended as the new marines approached they both noticed that the gate was unlocked ajarwhats this one asked eyeing the two drawn faces of the soldiers who stood against the wallits been that kind of night the elder responded the kind where you dont ask questionsthe two new men exchanged glances then the one who had spoken gave the older man a nod and a grin i know the kind well get on then your cots are waitingthe older man shifted his pike and seemed to sag his gaze flicked to his partner but the young man had his attention on something up the street id guess its too late now the older man said to the newcomers meaning it wont happen and so it dont matter but if a woman shows up a bridgeburner you let her through and keep your eyes on the wallslook at that dog the younger soldier saidwe hear you said the new man life in the secondlook at that dog the young marine repeatedthe others turned to look up the street the old guard stared his eyes widening then he hissed a curse and fumbled with his pike none of the others managed even that much before the hound was upon themsleepless tattersail lay flat on her back on the bed in the outer roomher exhaustion had reached a point where even sleep eluded her so she stared at the ceiling her thoughts wandering in a disordered review of the past seven days despite her initial anger at being embroiled in the bridgeburners schemes she had to acknowledge the excitement she feltthe desire to collect her possessions and open a warren away from the empire away from hairlocks madness and hunger away from the field of an endless war now seemed an ancient one born of a desperation she no longer feltbut it was more than just a renewed sense of humanity that compelled her to stay to see it throughthe bridgeburners after all had shown again and again that they could take care of their own affairs no she wanted to see tayschrenn pulled down it was a truth that frightened herhunger for vengeance poisoned the soul and it was likely that she would have to wait a long time to see tayschrenns just demise she wondered if having fed on that poison for so long she might not end up viewing the world with hairlocks shining bright mad eyestoo much she muttered too much all at oncea sound at the door startled her she sat up oh she said scowling youve returnedsafe and sound hairlock said sorry to disappoint you sail the marionette waved one tiny gloved hand and the door behind him closed its latch falling into place much feared these hounds of shadow he said sauntering into the rooms centre and pirouetting once before sitting down legs splayed and arms hanging limp he sniggered but in the end nothing more than glorified mutts stupid and slow and sniffing at every tree finding naught of sly hairlocktattersail leaned back and closed her eyes quick ben was displeased by your sloppinessfool hairlock spat i leave him to his watching i leave him convinced that such knowledge has power over me while i go where i choose he eagerly lays claim to commanding me a foolishness i give him now to make my vengeance sweetershe had heard it all before and knew he was working on her seeking to weaken her resolve unfortunately he was succeeding in part for she felt doubt maybe hairlock was telling the truth maybe quick ben had already lost him yet remained ignorant of the fact keep your vengeance for the man who stole your legs and then your body tattersail said drily tayschrenn still mocks youhell pay first hairlock shrieked then he hunched down gripping his sides one thing at a time he whisperedfrom the compound beyond the window came the first screamstattersail bolted upright as hairlock shouted found i mustnt be seen womanthe marionette leaped to his feet and scurried to his box against the far wall destroy the houndyouve no choice scrambling he opened the box and climbed inside the lid thudded into place and the nimbus of a protective spell suffused ittattersail stood by the bed hesitating wood shattered below and the building shook men shrieked weapons clanged the sorceress pushed herself upright terror seeping into her limbs like molten lead destroy a hound of shadow heavy thumps rattled the window as of bodies being flung aside on the floor below then the thumps reached the foot of the stairs and the screaming stopped from the compound she heard soldiers shoutingtattersail drew on her thyr warren power swept into her and pushed aside the paralysing fear she straightened all exhaustion gone and swung her gaze on the door wood creaked then the timber panel exploded inwards as if flung from a catapult and was instantly buffeted aside by tattersails magical shield the twin impacts shattered it flinging shards and splinters against the ceiling and walls glass broke behind her the windows shutters springing open an icy wind roiled into the roomthe hound appeared its eyes yellow flames the muscles of its high shoulders taut rippling under its skin the creatures power swept like a wave over tattersail and she drew a sharp breath the hound was old older than anything she had ever encountered it paused in the doorway sniffing the air blood dripping from its black lips then its gaze fixed on the ironbound box against the wall to tattersails left the beast stepped forwardno she saidthe hound froze its massive head swung slow and measured to her as if it was noticing her for the first time its lips peeled back to reveal the luminescent gleam of canines the length of a mans thumbdamn you hairlock i need your help pleasea white strip flashed above the hounds eyes as the lids snapped backit chargedthe attack was so swift that tattersail was unable to raise her hands before the beast was upon her surging through her outer magic as if it was no more than a brisk wind her closest defences a layering of high wards met the hounds charge like a stone wall she felt cracks streak outwards deep fissures reaching through to her arms and chest with a snapping sound immediately replaced by spurting blood this and the hounds momentum flung her back through the air the wards at her back cushioned the blow as she hit the wall beside the window mortar puffed into the air around her and fragments of crushed brick scattered across the floorthe hound had fallen to its knees shaking its head it regained its feet snorted then attacked againtattersail her wits rocked by the first charge weakly lifted one bloodstreaked arm before her face unable to do anything elseas the hound sprang into the air jaws open and reaching for her head a wave of grey light struck the beast in the side throwing it into the bed to tattersails right wood crunched with a grunt the hound was up again wheeling this time to face hairlock who stood perched atop his box glistening with sweat and arms raised oh yes gear he shrilled im your quarrytattersail slumped then leaned to one side and vomited on the floora chaotic warren swirled in the room a miasma that churned into her like riotous pestilence it radiated from hairlock in visible pulses of grainy grey shot through with blackthe hound eyed hairlock its sides heaving it was as if it was trying to dispel the waves of power from its brain a low growl rumbled in its chestits first sound the wide head saggedtattersail stared then understanding struck a hammer blow to her chest hound she screamed hes reaching for your soul escape get out of herethe beasts growl deepened but it did not movenone of the three noticed the door to the inner bedroom opening off to the left or the halting appearance of captain paran wrapped in the colourless woollen blanket that covered him down to his ankles pale and drawn the man moved forward a blank cast to his eyes which were fixed on the hound as the invisible battle of wills continued between gear and hairlock paran stepped closerthe movement caught tattersails eye she opened her mouth to shout a warning but paran moved first the blanket parted to reveal a longsword point flashing outward as he extended into a full lunge the sword sank into gears chest even as the man leaped back withdrawing the lunge twisting the weapon as he pulled it clear a bellow thundered from gears throat the hound staggered back into the ruins of the bed biting at the wound gushing blood from its sidehairlock screamed in rage and jumped forward closing in on geartattersail scythed one foot into the puppets path flinging him against the far wallgear howled a dark rift opened around him with the sound of tearing burlap he whirled and plunged into the deepening shadow the rent closed and was gone leaving in its wake a rippling of cold airastonished beyond her pain tattersail swung her attention to captain paran and the bloodied sword in his hands how she gasped how could you have pierced the hounds magic your swordthe captain looked down at it just lucky i supposeoponn hairlock hissed as he regained his feet and glared at tattersail hoods curse on the fools and you woman this ill not forget you will payi swear it tattersail looked away and sighed a smile touched her lips as words uttered earlier now returned with new grim meaning youll be too busy staying alive hairlock to start on me youve given shadowthrone something to think about and youll live to regret his attention puppet deny that if you dareim returning to my box hairlock said scrambling expect tayschrenn here in minutes youll say nothing sorceress he clambered inside nothing the lid slammed shuttattersails smile broadened the taste of blood in her mouth like an omen a silent visible warning to hairlock of things to comea warning she knew he couldnt see that made the taste almost sweetshe tried to move but it seemed that a chill had come to her limbswithin her mind visions floated but walls of darkness closed in around them before they could register she felt herself fadinga mans voice spoke close by urgent what do you hearshe frowned trying to concentrate then she smiled a spinning coin i hear a spinning coinbook two darujhistanwhat windfall has brushed our sensesthis rocking thunderhead that scraped the lakes placid waters and spun a

leaving the city of darujhistan through two ox gate as he headed towards the setting sun the tattered tails of his faded red waistcoat flapped in his hastehe had no idea how far he would have to walk already his feet achedthere were miseries in the world and then there was misery in times of conscience he held the worlds concerns above his own fortunately he reflected such times were few and this he told himself was not one of themalas the very same dream propels these manytoed implements beneath these wobbly knees he sighed ever the same dream and so it was he saw before him the sun riding the distant hilltop a copper disc through woodsmoke haze his feet carried him down the winding dirt street of gadrobi shantytown the shacks and huts on either side crouching in the gathering gloom old men wrapped in the dingy yellow rags of lepers squatted over nearby cookfires falling silent as he passedsimilarly clad women stood by the muddy well pausing in their endless dunking of catsa bemusing activity its symbolism lost on the man as he hurried pasthe crossed maiten river bridge passed through the dwindling gadrobi herder camps out on to the open road flanked by vineyard plantations he lingered here thinking of the wine these succulent grapes would produce but dreams carried on with their own momentum and the thought was but fleeting in its passagehe knew his mind was in flightfleeing the doomed city at his back fleeing the dark brooding smudge in the sky above it but most of all fleeing all that he knew and all that he wasfor some the talent they possessed found its channel through a toss of knucklebones the reading of heat fractures in scapulae or the fatid of the deck of dragons for kruppe he had no need of any such affectations the power of divination was in his head and he could not deny it no matter how hard he tried within the walls of his skull rang the dirge of prophecy and it echoed through his boneshe muttered under his breath of course this is a dream the flight of sleep perhaps thinks kruppe he will in truth escape this time none could call kruppe a fool after all fat with sloth and neglect yes inclined to excesses indeed somewhat clumsy with a bowl of soup most certainly but not a fool such times are upon us when the wise man must choose is it not wisdom to conclude that other lives are of less importance than ones own of course very wise yes kruppe is wisehe paused to catch his breath the hills and the sun before him seemed no closer such were dreams like the hastening of youth into adulthood a precipitous course one could never turn back onbut who mentioned youth or one youth in particular surely not wise kruppe his mind wanderskruppe excuses the pun magnanimouslyracked by the misery of his soles which are tired nay half worn out from this reckless pace blisters have already appeared no doubt the foot cries out for a warm soapy balm its companion joins in the chorus ah such a litany such a wail of despair cease complaining dear wings of flight how far is the sun anyway just beyond the hills kruppe is certain no more than that surely yes as certain as an everspinning coinbut who spoke of coins kruppe proclaims his innocence a breeze swept into his dream down from the north carrying with it the smell of rain kruppe began fastening his threadbare coat he drew in his belly in an effort to secure the last two buttons but succeeded in clasping only one even in sleep he groaned guilt makes its pointhe blinked against the wind rain but the year has just begun does it rain in the spring kruppe has never before concerned himself with such mundane matters perhaps this scent is no more than the lakes own breath yes indeed the question is settled he squinted at the dark ridge of clouds above lake azurmust kruppe run nay where is his pride his dignity not once have they shown their faces in kruppes dreams is there no shelter on yon road ah kruppes feet are flailed his soles bloodied shreds of throbbing flesh whats thisup ahead was a crossroads a building squatted on a low rise just beyond candlelight bled from its shuttered windowskruppe smiled of course an inn far has the journey been clear the need for a place of rest and relaxation for the weary traveller such as kruppe wizened adventurer with more than a few leagues under his belt not to mention spanning it he hurried forwarda broad barelimbed tree marked the crossroads from one heavy branch something long and wrapped in burlap swung creaking in the wind kruppe spared it but the briefest glance he came to the path and began his ascentill judgement pronounces kruppe inns for the dusty journeyman should not sit atop hills the curse of climbing is discovering how great the distance yet to climb a word to the proprietor shall be necessaryonce sweet ale has soothed the throat slabs of juicy red meat and broiled yams eased the gullet and clean anointed bandages clothed the feet such repairs must take precedence over flaws in planning such as kruppe sees herehis monologue fell away replaced by gasps as he struggled up the path when he arrived at the door kruppe was so winded that he did not even so much as look up merely pushed against the weathered panel until it swung inward with a squeal of rusty hinges alas he cried pausing to brush the sleeves of his coat a foamy tankard for thishis voice died as he surveyed the array of grimy faces turned to himmethinks the business is poor he mumbled the place was indeed an innor it had been perhaps a century past tis rain in the night air he said to the halfdozen beggars crouched around a thick tallow candle set on the earthen floorone of the fellows nodded we will grant you audience hapless onehe waved at a straw mat be seated and entertain our presencekruppe raised an eyebrow kruppe is graced by your invitation sirehe dipped his head then strode forward but please do not think he is bereft of contributions to this honoured gathering he sat down crosslegged grunting with the effort and faced the one who had spoken he would break bread with you all from a sleeve he withdrew a small rye loaf a bread knife appeared in his other hand known to friends an strangers alike is kruppe the man now seated before you inhabitant of yon glittering darujhistan the mystic jewel of genabackis the juicy grape ripe for picking he produced a chunk of goat cheese and smiled broadly at the faces before him and this is his dreamso it is the beggars spokesman said his lined face crinkling with amusement it ever pleases us when we taste your particular flavour kruppe of darujhistan and always are we pleased at your travelling appetiteskruppe laid down the rye loaf and cut slices kruppe has always considered you mere aspects of himself a halfdozen hungers among many as it were yet for all your needs you would urge what of your master that he turn back from his flight of course that ones own skull is too worthy a chamber for deception to reignand yet kruppe assures you from long experience that all deceit is born in the mind and there it is nurtured while virtues starvethe spokesman accepted a slice of bread and smiled perhaps we are your virtues thenkruppe paused to study the cheese in his hand a thought kruppe has not considered before now mingling with the silent observation of mould on this cheese but alas the subject is in danger of being lost within the maze of such semantics nor can beggars be choosers when it comes to cheese you have returned once again and kruppe knows why as he has already explained with admirable equanimitythe coin spins kruppe still spins the spokesmans face lost its humourkruppe sighed he handed the chunk of goat cheese to the man seated on his right kruppe hears it he conceded wearily he cannot help but hear it an endless ringing that sings in the head and for all that kruppe has seen for all that he suspects to be he is just kruppe a man who would challenge the gods in their own gameperhaps we are your doubts the spokesman said which you have never been afraid to face before as you do now yet even we seek to turn you back even we demand that you strive for the life of darujhistan for the life of your many friends and for the life of the youth at whos feet the coin shall fallit falls this very night kruppe said the six beggars nodded at this though mostly they remained intent on the bread and cheese shall kruppe accept this challenge then what are gods after all if not the perfect victims he smiled raising his hands and fluttering his fingers for kruppe whose sleight of hand is matched only by his sleight of mind perfect victims of confidence claims kruppe ever blinded by arrogance ever convinced of infallibility is it not a wonder that they have survived this longthe spokesman nodded and said around a mouthful of cheese perhaps we are your gifts then wasting away as it werepossibly kruppe said his eyes narrowing yet only one of you speaksthe beggar paused to swallow then he laughed his eyes dancing in the candlelight perhaps the others have yet to find their voice kruppethey await only their masters commandmy kruppe sighed as he prepared to stand but kruppe is full of surprisesthe spokesman looked up you return to darujhistanof course kruppe replied gaining his feet with a heartfelt groan he merely stepped out for a breath of night air so much cleaner beyond the citys crumbling walls dont you agree kruppe must needs exercise to hone his already prodigious skills a walk in his sleep this night he said hitching his thumbs in his belt the coin falls kruppe must take his place in the centre of things he returns to his bed the night still younghis eyes travelled among the beggars all seemed to have gained weight a healthy robust colour to their upturned faces kruppe sighed with satisfaction it has pronounces kruppe been a pleasure gentlemen next time however let us settle on an inn that is not on a hilltop agreedthe spokesman smiled ah but kruppe gifts are not easily attained nor are virtues nor are doubts easily overcome and hungers are ever the impetus to climbingkruppes eyes narrowed on the man kruppe is too clever by far he mutteredhe left their company and shut the creaking door softly behind himreturning down the path he came to the crossroads and stopped in front of the burlapwrapped figure swinging from the branch kruppe planted his fists on his hips and studied it i know who you are he said joviallythe final aspect of kruppe to complete this dreams array of those faces facing him which are kruppes own or so you would proclaim you are humility but as everyone knows humility has no place in kruppes life remember that so here you will stay with that he moved his gaze to the great city lighting the eastern sky blue and green ah this wondrous fiery gem that is darujhistan is home to kruppe and that he added as he began to walk is as it should befrom the wharf sprawled along the shore of the lake upward along the stepped tiers of the gadrobi and daru districts among the temple complexes and the higher estates to the summit of majesty hill where gathers the citys council the rooftops of darujhistan presented flat tops arched gables coned towers belfries and platforms crowded in such chaotic profusion as to leave all but the major streets for ever hidden from the sunthe torches marking the more frequented alleyways were hollow shafts that gripped pumice stones with fingers of blackened iron fed through ancient pitted copper pipes gas hissed balls of flame around the porous stones an uneven fire that cast a blue and green light the gas was drawn from great caverns beneath the city and channelled by massive valves attending these works were the greyfaces silent men and women who moved like spectres beneath the citys cobbled streetsfor nine hundred years the breath of gas had fed at least one of the citys districts though pipes had been sundered by raging tenement fires and gouts of flame reached hundreds of feet into the sky the greyfaces had held on twisting the shackles and driving their invisible dragon to its kneesbeneath the rooftops was an underworld forever bathed in a blue glow such light marked the major avenues and the oftfrequented narrow and crooked thoroughways of the markets in the city however over twenty thousand alleys barely wide enough for a twowheeled cart remained in shadow broken only by the occasional torchbearing citizen by day the rooftops were bright and hot beneath the sun crowded with the fluttering flags of domestic life drying in the lake wind by night the stars and moon illuminated a world webbed with empty clotheslineson this night a figure wove around the hemp ropes and through the faint shadows overhead a sickle moon sliced its way between thin clouds like a gods scimitar the figure wore sootstained cloth wrapped snugly about its torso and limbs and its face was similarly hidden leaving only space enough for its eyes which scanned the nearby rooftops a black leather harness crisscrossed the figures chest bearing pockets and tight stiff loops holding tools of the trade coils of copper wire iron files three metal saws each wrapped in oiled parchment root gum and a squared lump of tallow a spool of fishing string a thinbladed dagger and a throwing knife both sheathed under the figures left the tips of the thiefs moccasins had been soaked in pitch as he crossed the flat rooftop he was careful not to lower his full weight on his toes leaving mostly intact the halfinch strip of sticky tar he came to the buildings edge and looked down three flights below crouched a small garden faintly lit by four gas lamps set at each corner of a flagstoned patio that encircled a fountain a purple glow clung to the foliage encroaching on the patio and glimmered on the water trickling down a series of stone tiers to the fountains shallow pool on a bench beside the fountain sat a guard reclined in sleep a spear across his kneesthe darle estate was a popular topic among the higher circles of darujhistans nobility specifically for the eligibility of the familys youngest daughter many had been the suitors many the gifts of gems and baubles that now resided in the young maidens bedroomwhile such stories were passed like the sweetest bread in the upper circles few of the commonry paid attention when the tales trickled down into their company but there were those who listened carefully indeed possessive and mute with their thoughts yet oddly eager for detailshis gaze on the dozing house guard in the garden below the mind of crokus yourighand picked its way carefully through speculations of what was to come the key lay in finding out which room among the estates score of chambers belonged to the maiden crokus did not like guesswork but hed found that his thoughts carried almost entirely on instinct moved with their own logic when determining these thingstop floor most assuredly for the youngest and fairest daughter of the darles and with a balcony overlooking the gardenhe turned his attention from the guard to the wall immediately beneath him three balconies but only one off to the left was on the third floor crokus pulled back from the edge and slipped silently along the roof until he judged he was directly above the balcony then he approached again and looked downten feet at the most on either side of the balcony rose ornately carved columns of painted wood a halfmoon arch spanned them an arms length down completing the fancy frame with a final glance at the house guard who had not moved and whose spear did not seem in danger of clattering to the flagstones at any moment crokus slowly lowered himself down the wallhis moccasins pitch gripped the eaves with snug assurance there were plenty of handholds as the carver had cut deep into the hardwood and sun rain and wind had weathered the paint he descended along one of the columns until his feet touched the balconys handrail where it abutted the wall a moment later he crouched on the glazed tiles in the shadow of a wroughtiron table and pillowed chairno light leaked between the shutters of the sliding door two soft steps brought him next to it a moments examination identified the style of the latchs lock crokus withdrew a finetoothed saw and set to work the sound the tool made was minimal no more than the shivering of a locusts leg a fine tool rare and probably expensive crokus was fortunate in having an uncle who dabbled in alchemy and had need of such magically hardened tools when constructing his bizarre condensing and filtering mechanisms better yet an absentminded uncle prone to misplacing thingstwenty minutes later the saws teeth snipped the last restraining bolthe returned the tool to his harness wiped the sweat from his hands then nudged the door opencrokus poked his head into the room in the grey dimness he saw a large fourposter bed a few feet to his left its headboard against the outer wall mosquito netting descended around it ending in piled heaps on the floor from within came the even breaths of someone deep in sleep the room was redolent of expensive perfume something spicy and probably from callowsimmediately across from him were two doors one ajar and leading into a bathing chamber the other a formidable barrier of banded oak sporting an enormous lock against the wall to his right stood a clothes cupboard and a makeup stand over which stood three polished silver mirrors hinged together the centre one rose flush on the wall the outer two angled on to the tabletop to provide an infinity of admiring visagescrokus turned sideways and edged into the room he rose slowly and stretched relieving his muscles of the tension that had held them for the past halfhour he swung his gaze to the makeup stand then tiptoed towards itthe darle estate was third from the summit of old kruls avenue which climbed the first of the inner citys hills to a circular court tangled with weeds and irregular halfburied dolmens opposite the court rose krul temple its ancient stones latticed with cracks and entombed in mossthe last monk of the eldering god had died generations past the square belfry that rose from the temples inner court bore architectural stylings of a people long dead four rose marble posts marked the corners of the high platform still holding aloft a peaked roof with sides that were scaled in greenstained bronze tilesthe belfry overlooked a dozen flat roofs of houses that belonged to gentry one such structure crowded close to one of the temples roughhewn walls and across its roof lay the heavy shadow of the tower on this roof crouched an assassin with blood on his handstalo krafar of jurig denattes clan drew breath in hissing gasps sweat trickled muddy streaks down his brow and droplets fell from his broad crooked nose his dark eyes were wide as he stared down at his hands for the blood staining them was his ownhis mission this night had been as a roamer patrolling the citys rooftops which except for the occasional thief were the assassins sole domain the means by which they travelled the city for the most part undetected the rooftops provided their routes on missions of unsanctioned political activities or the continuation of a feud between two houses or the punishment for betrayal the council ruled by day under public scrutiny the guild ruled by night unseen leaving no witnesses it had always been this way since darujhistan first rose on the shores of lake azurtalo had been crossing an innocuous rooftop when a crossbow quarrel had driven a hammer blow to his left shoulder he was flung forward by the concussion and for an unknown length of time stared dumbfounded at the cloudwreathed sky overhead wondering what had happenedfinally as numbness slowly gave way to agony he twisted on to his sidethe quarrel had gone entirely through him it lay on the tarred tiles a few feet away he rolled until he was beside the bloodied boltone glance had been enough to confirm that this was no thiefs quarrel it had come from a heavy weaponan assassins weapon as this fact worked its way through the confused jumble of talos thoughts he drew himself up to his knees and then to his feet an unsteady jog brought him to the buildings edgeblood streamed from the wound as he climbed down to the unlit alley below his moccasins resting finally on the slick rubbishlittered cobblestones he paused forcing clarity into his head an assassin war had begun this night but which clan leader was fool enough to believe he or she could usurp vorcans mastery of the guild in any case he would return to his clans nest if possible with this in mind he began to runhe had dashed into the shadows of his third alley when ice trickled down his spine breath catching talo froze the sensation creeping over him was unmistakable as certain as instinct he was being stalked he glanced down at the bloodsoaked front of his shirt and realized that there was no hope of outrunning his hunter no doubt his stalker had seen him enter the alley and even now had a crossbow trained on its mouth at the far end at least that is how xxx hed have to turn the game round set a trap and for that hed need  mouth he had just entered the rooftops talo turned back to the alley and studied the nearby buildings two streets to his right squatted the krul temple his gaze fixed on the dark edifice that was the belfrytherethe climb left him close to unconsciousness and he now crouched in the belfrys shadow one building away from the temple his exertions had pumped blood from his shoulder in horrifying volume hed seen blood before of course but never so much of his own at one time he wondered for the first time seriously if he would die a numbness spread in his arms and legs and he knew if he remained where he was any longer he might never leave with a soft grunt he pushed himself uprightthe jump down to the temple roof was only a matter of a few yards but the impact jarred him to his kneesgasping talo drove thoughts of failure from his mind all that was left was to climb down the temples inner wall to the court then ascend the belfrys spiral staircase two tasks two simple tasks and once within the belfrys shadows he could command every nearby rooftopand the stalker would come to him talo paused to check his own crossbow which was strapped to his back and the three quarrels sheathed on his left thighhe glared into the darkness around him whoever you are you bastard he whispered i want youhe began to crawl across the temple roofthe lock on the jewel box had proved simple to pick ten minutes after entering the room crokus had swept it clean a small fortunes worth of gold gem and pearlstudded jewellery now resided in a small leather bag tied to his belthe squatted by the dressingtable and held in his hands his final prizethis ill keep the item was a skyblue silk turban with goldbraided tassels no doubt intended for the upcoming rite he ended his long minute of admiration tucked the turban under an arm then rose his gaze lingered on the bed across from him and he moved closerthe netting obscured the form half buried beneath soft blanketsanother step brought him to the bedframes edge from the waist up the girl was naked an embarrassed flush rose in the thiefs cheeks but he did not look away queen of dreams but shes lovely at seventeen years of age crokus had seen enough whores and dancers not to tremble agape at a womans exposed virtues even still his gaze lingered then grimacing he headed back to the balcony door a moment later he was outside he drew a deep breath of the cool night air to clear his head in the blanket of darkness overhead a handful of stars shone sufficiently bright to pierce the gauze of clouds not clouds but smoke drifting across the lake from the north the word of pales fall to the malazan empire had been on the tongues of everyone for the past two daysand were nexthis uncle had told him that the council still frantically proclaimed neutrality desperate in their efforts to separate the city from the now destroyed free cities alliance but the malazans didnt seem to be listening and why should they uncle mammot had asked darujhistans army is a contemptible handful of noble sons who do nothing but strut back and forth on whore street gripping their jewelled swordscrokus climbed to the estates roof and padded silently across its tilesanother house of equal height was before him its flat top less than six feet away the thief paused at the edge and looked down to the alley thirty feet below seeing only a pool of darkness then he jumped to land softly on the next roofhe began to cross it off to his left rose the stark silhouette of kruls belfry tower gnarled like a bony fist thrust into the night sky crokus brought one hand down to the leather bag tied to his belt probing with his fingers the knot and the condition of the drawstrings satisfied that all was secure he checked the turban tucked beneath a strap of his harness all was well he continued his soundless way across the rooftop a fine night indeed crokus smiled to himselftalo krafar opened his eyes dazed and uncomprehending he stared about himself where was he why did he feel so weak then memory returned and a groan slipped from his lips he had blacked out leaning here against this marble pillar but what had awoken him stiffening the assassin pushed himself up on the dusty column and scanned the rooftops below there a figure moved across the flat top of a building less that fifty feet awaynow you bastard now he raised his crossbow anchoring one elbow against the pillar he had already cocked his weapon though he had no memory of having done so at this distance there was no chance of missing in seconds his stalker would be dead talo bared his teeth and took careful aimcrokus was halfway across the rooftop one hand tracing the silk finery of the turban snug over his heart when a coin clattered loudly at his feetinstinctively he pounced down and trapped it beneath both handssomething hissed through the air immediately above his head and he looked up startled then ducked again as a ceramic tile shattered twenty feet awayhe moaned with sudden realization as he clambered to his feet one hand absently collected the coin and tucked it under his belttalo cursed in disbelief he lowered the crossbow and stared down at the figure dumbfounded until his instinct for danger asserted itself one last time whirling he caught a blurred glimpse of a cloaked figure standing before him arms raised then the arms flashed down and two long grooved daggers slid into talos chest with a final baffled grunt the assassin dieda grating sound reached crokuss ears and he spun to face the belfry a black shape tumbled from between the pillars and landed with a thump fifteen feet away moments later a crossbow clanged down beside itcrokus looked up to see a silhouette framed between the pillars glittering longbladed knives in its hands the figure seemed to be studying himoh mowri the thief prayed then turned and ranin the krul belfry the killers oddly shaped eyes watched the thief scamper towards the rooftops far side with a slight lifting of its head the killer sniffed the air then frowned a burst of power had just frayed the fabric of night like a finger poking through rotted cloth and through the rent something had comethe thief reached the far edge and disappeared over it the killer hissed a spell in a language older than the belfry and the temple a language that had not been heard in this land for millennia then sprang from the tower enwreathed in magic the killers descent to the rooftop below was slow controlled the landing came as a light brush on the tilesa second figure appeared its cloak spread like a black wing from the above darkness to join the first then a third also descending in silence landed on the rooftop they spoke briefly the last to arrive muttered a command then moved off the remaining two exchanged a few last words then set out on the thiefs trail the second one preparing its crossbowten minutes later crokus leaned against the sloped roof of a merchants house to regain his breath hed seen no one heard nothing either the killer hadnt pursued or he had managed to lose him or her in his mind returned his single vision of the figure as it stood in the belfry no unlikely that it could be a womantoo tall perhaps six and a half feet and thina tremor ran through the young thief what had he stumbled on an assassin had almost skewered him and then had himself been murdeieda guild war if so it made the rooftops a risky place to bewarily crokus rose and looked about hima tile further along the roof clattered down the sloped side crokus whirled to see the killer dashing towards him one look at the two daggers flashing in the air and the thief darted to the roofs edge and leaped out into darknessthe building across from him was too distant but crokus had chosen his resting place on familiar territory as he fell into the shadows he reached out grasping hands the guidewire caught his arms near the elbows and he scrambled frantically for a secure grip then hung dangling twenty feet above the alleywhile most of the clotheslines spanning the citys streets were just thin unreliable hemp among them were wrapped wires placed by thieves generations past they were securely bolted to the walls by day monkey road as the thieves called it looked no different from any other line festooned with undergarments and sheets with the suns setting however came its true purposewith hands burned raw crokus made his way along the wire towards the far wall he chanced to glance up then and froze on the roofs edge before him stood a second hunter taking careful aim with a heavy antique crossbowcrokus let go of the wire a quarrel whizzed directly above his head as he fell from behind and below a window shattered his drop was cut short by the first of a series of clotheslines tugging his limbs and twitching him about before snapping after what seemed an eternity of bonewrenching jerks and the whip of cord slicing through his clothes and flaying his skin crokus struck the alleys cobblestones straightlegged and leaning far forward his knees buckled he dipped a shoulder enough to earn a slightly cushioned roll brought up short when his head struck a walldazed and groaning crokus pushed himself upright he looked upthrough vision blurred with pain he saw a figure descending in seeming slowmotion immediately overhead the thiefs eyes widened sorceryhe turned and staggered dizzily before managing a limping run down the alleyway he reached the corner and briefly lit by gaslight hurried across a wide street then entered the mouth of another alley once in its shadow crokus stopped cautiously he poked his head out from the walls edge for a look a quarrel struck the brick beside his face he jumped back into the alley spun and sprintedabove him crokus heard the flapping of a cloak a burning spasm in his left hip made him stumble another quarrel whipped past his shoulder and skidded on the cobblestones the spasm passed as quickly as it had come and he staggered on ahead at the alleymouth was the lit doorway of a tenement an old woman sat on the stone steps puffing on a pipe her eyes glittered as she watched the thief approach as crokus bounded past her and up the steps she rapped the pipe against the sole of her shoe sparks rained on to the cobblescrokus pushed open the door and plunged inside he paused a narrow poorly lit hallway was before him a staircase crowded with children at the far end his eyes on the stairs he jogged up the hall from the curtained doorways on either side came a cacophony of noise voices raised in argument wailing babies the clatter of cookwaredont you people ever sleep crokus shouted as he ran the children on the stairs scampered out of his way and he took the warped steps two at a time on the top floor he stopped at a door a third of the way down the hall this one solid oak he pushed it open and entered the room withinan old man sitting behind a massive desk looked up briefly from his work then resumed his frantic scrawl on a sheet of crinkled parchmentevening crokus he said distractedlyand to you uncle crokus gaspedon uncle mammots shoulder squatted a small winged monkey whose glittering halfmad gaze followed the young thiefs dart across the room to the window opposite the door flinging open the shutters crokus climbed up on to the sill below was a squalid overgrown garden mostly lost in shadows a lone gnarled tree rose upward he eyed the branches across from him then gripped the windowframe and leaned back he drew a deep breath then propelled himself forwardas he passed through the intervening gap he heard a surprised grunt come from directly above then a wild scratching against stone an instant later someone crashed down into the garden below cats shrieked and a voice groaned out a single pained cursecrokus clung to a bowing branch he timed each bounce of the resilient wood then extended his legs as the branch pulled him up his moccasins landed on a windowsill and held grunting he swung himself on to it and let go of the branch he punched at the wooden shuttersthey sprang inward and crokus followed head first down on to the floor and rolling to his feethe heard movement from another room in the apartment scrambling to his feet he bolted for the hallway door flung it open and slipped out just as a hoarse voice shouted a curse behind him crokus ran to the far end of the passage where a ladder led to a hatch on the ceilingsoon he was on the roof he crouched in the darkness and tried to catch his breath the burning sensation returned to his hip he must have damaged something in his fall from the guidewire he reached down to massage the spot and found his fingers pressing something hard round and hot the coin crokus reached for itjust then he heard a sudden whistling sound and chips of stone spattered him ducking he saw a quarrel its shaft split by the impact bounce once on the rooftop then plummet over the edge spinning wildlya soft moan escaped his lips and he scrambled across the roof to the far side without pause he jumped ten feet down was an awning sagged and stretched out of shape on which he landed the iron spars framing the canvas dipped but held from there it was a quick climb down to the streetcrokus jogged to the corner where an old building squatted with yellow light bleeding through dirty windows a wooden sign hung above the door bearing the faded image of a bird dead on its back feet jutting upward the thief bounded up the steps and pushed open the doora rush of light and noise washed over him like balm he slammed the door behind him and leaned against it he closed his eyes pulling the disguising cloth from his face and head revealing shoulderlength black hairnow dripping with sweatand regular features surrounding light blue eyesas he reached up to wipe his brow a mug was pushed into his handcrokus opened his eyes to see sulty hurry by carrying on one hand a tray loaded with pewter tankards she glanced at him over her shoulder and grinned rough night crokushe stared at her then said no nothing special he raised the mug to his lips and drank deepacross the street from the ramshackle phoenix inn a hunter stood at the roofs edge and studied the door through which the thief had just passedthe crossbow lay cradled in its armsthe second hunter arrived sheathing two longknives as it came alongside the firstwhat happened to you the first hunter asked quietly in its native tonguehad an argument with a catthe two were silent for a moment then the first hunter sighed worriedly all in all too awry to be naturalthe other agreed you felt the parting too thenan ascendant meddled too cautious to show itself fully howeverunfortunate its been years since i last killed an ascendantthey began to check their weapons the first hunter loaded the crossbow and slipped four extra quarrels in its belt the second hunter removed each longknife and cleaned it carefully of sweat and grimethey heard someone approach from behind and turned to see their commanderhes in the inn the second hunter saidwell leave no witnesses to this secret war with the guild the first addedthe commander glanced at the door of the phoenix inn then to the hunters she said no the wagging tongue of a witness might be useful to our effortsthe runt had help the first hunter said meaningfullythe commander shook her head we return to the foldvery wellthe two hunters put away their weapons the first glanced back at the inn and asked who protected him do you thinkthe second hunter snarled someone with a sense of humourchapter sixthere is a cabal breathing deeper than the bellows drawing up the emerald fires beneath rainglistened cobbles while you may hear the groaning from the caverns below the whisper of sorcery is less than the dying sigh of a thief stumbling unwilling into darujhistans secret web cabal fragmentpuddle b the splayed tip of her right wing brushed the scarred black rock as crone climbed the whistling updraughts of moons spawn from the pocked caves and starlit ledges her restless brothers and sisters called out to her as she passed do we fly they asked but crone made no reply her glittering black eyes were fixed on heavens vault her enormous wings beat a thundering refrain of taut unrelenting power she had no time for the nervous cackling of the younglings no time for answering their simplistic needs with the wisdom her thousand years of life had earned herthis night crone flew for her lordas she rose above the shattered peaks of the moons crest a high wind swept her wings rasping dry and cold along her oily feathers around her thin wisps of shredded smoke rode the currents of night air like lost spirits crone circled once her sharp gaze catching the glimmer of the few remaining fires among the crags below then she dipped a wing and sailed out on the winds tide as it rolled northward to lake azurthe featureless expanse of the dwelling plain was beneath her the grass sweeping in grey waves unbroken by house or hill directly ahead lay the glittering jewelled cloak that was darujhistan casting into the sky a sapphire glow as she neared the city her unnaturally acute vision detected here and there among the estates crowding the upper tier the aquamarine emanation of sorcerycrone cackled aloud magic was ambrosia to great ravens they were drawn to it by the scent of blood and power and within its aura their lifespans lengthened into

portcullisconnected the lower and upper citieson the fourth and highest tier brooded the estates of darujhistans nobility as well as its publicly known sorcerers at the intersection of old kings walk and view street rose a flattopped hill on which sat majesty hall where each day the council gathered a narrow park encircled the hill with sandstrewn pathways winding among centuriesold acacias at the parks entrance near high gallows hill stood a massive roughhewn stone gate the lastsurviving remnant of the castle that once commanded majesty hillthe days of kings had long since ended in darujhistan the gate known as despots barbican stood stark and unadorned its lattice of cracks a fading script of past tyrannyin the shadow of the barbicans single massive lintel stone stood two men one his shoulder against the pitted rock wore a ringed hauberk and a boiled leather cap bearing the city watch insignia scabbarded to his belt was a plain shortsword its grip of wrapped leather worn smooth a pike leaned against one shoulder he was nearing the end of his midnight guard duty and patiently awaited the arrival of the man who would officially relieve him the guards eyes flicked on occasion to the second man with whom he had shared this place many another night over the past year the glances he cast at the welldressed gentleman were surreptitious empty of expressionas with every other time councilman turban orr came to the gate at this dead hour of night the nobleman had scarcely deemed the guard worthy of notice nor had he ever given an indication that he recognized the guard as being the same man each timeturban orr seemed a man short on patience forever pacing and fretting pausing every now and then to adjust his jewelled burgundy cloak the councilmans polished boots clicked as he paced throwing a soft echo under the barbican from the shadow the guards gaze caught orrs gloved hand where it rested on the silver pommel of a duelling sword noting the index finger tapping in time with the boot clicksat the early part of his watch long before the arrival of the councilman the guard would walk slowly around the barbican reaching out on occasion to touch the ancient grim stonework six years worth of night watch at this gate had bred a close relationship between the man and the roughcut basalt he knew every crack every chisel scar he knew where the fittings had weakened where time and the elements had squeezed mortar from between the stones then gnawed it to dust and he also knew that its apparent weaknesses were but a deception the barbican and all it stood for patiently waited still a spectre of the past hungry to be born yet againand that the guard had long ago vowed he would never let it doif such things were within his power despots barbican provided the man with every reason he needed to be what he was circle breaker a spyboth he and the councilman awaited the arrival of the other the one who never failed to appear turban orr would growl his usual complaint disgusted with tardiness then he would grasp the others arm and they would walk side by side beneath the barbicans brooding lintel stone and with eyes long accustomed to darkness the guard would mark the others face burning it indelibly in the superb memory hidden behind expressionless unmemorable featuresby the time the two council members returned from their walk the guard would have been relieved and well on his way to delivering a message according to his masters instructions if circle breakers luck held he might survive the civil war into which darujhistan he felt was about to plungeand never mind the malazan nemesis one nightmare at a time he often told himself particularly on nights like these when despots barbican seemed to breathe its promise of resurrection with mocking certaintyas this may be in your interest high alchemist baruk read aloud from the parchment note in his plump hands always the same opening line hinting of disquieting knowledge an hour earlier his servant roald had delivered the note which like all the others that had come to him over the past year had been found tucked into one of the ornamental murder holes in the estates rear postern gaterecognizing the pattern baruk had immediately read the missive then dispatched his messengers out into the city such news demanded action and he was one of the few secret powers within darujhistan capable of dealing with itnow he sat in a plush chair in his study musing his deceptively sleepy gaze flicked down again to the words on the parchment councilman turban orr walks in the garden with councilman feder i remain known only as circle breaker a servant of the eel whose interests continue to coincide with your own once again baruk felt temptation with his talents it would be a small thing to discover the writers identitythough not the eels of course that was an identity sought by many all to no availbut as always something held him backhe shifted his bulk on the chair and sighed very well circle breaker ill continue to honour you though clearly you know more of me than i of you and fortunate it is indeed that your masters interests coincide with my own still he frowned thinking about the eel about the mansor womansundisclosed interests he knew enough to recognize that too many forces had come into playa gathering of ascendant powers was a fell thing to continue to step unseen in defence of the city was becoming increasingly difficult so the question came yet again was this eel using him as welloddly enough he did not feel too concerned about this possibility so much vital information had been passed into his hands alreadyhe folded the parchment carefully and muttered a simple cantrip the note vanished with a small plop of displaced air joining the others in a safe placebaruk closed his eyes behind him the broad window shutters rattled in a gust of wind then settled again a moment later there came a sharp rap against the smoky glass baruk sat upright his eyes startled open a second rap louder than the first brought him round with a swift alacrity surprising for one of his girth on his feet he faced the windowsomething crouched on the ledge visible through the shutters only as a bulky black shapebaruk frowned impossible nothing could penetrate his magic barriers undetected the alchemist gestured with one hand and the shutters sprang open behind the glass waited a great raven its head snapped to view baruk with one eye then the other it pushed boldly against the thin glass with its massive ridged chest the pane bulged then shatteredhis warren fully open baruk raised both hands a savage spell on his lipsdont waste your breath the raven rasped swelling its chest and ruffling its mangy feathers to rid itself of glass shards it cocked its headyouve called your guards it observed no need wizard a single hop brought the enormous bird on to the floor i bring words you will value have you anything to eatbaruk studied the creature im not in the habit of inviting great ravens into my home he said you are no disguised demon eitherof course not im named crone her head bobbed mockingly at your pleasure lordbaruk hesitated considering after a moment he sighed and said very well ive returned my guards to their posts my servant roald comes with the leavings of supper if thats agreeable to youexcellent crone waddled across the floor to settle on the rug before the fireplace there lord now a calming crystal of wine dont you thinkwho has sent you crone baruk asked walking over to the decanter on his desk normally he did not drink after sunset for night was when he worked but he had to acknowledge crones perceptiveness a calming balm was exactly what he neededthe great raven hesitated slightly before answering the lord of moons spawnbaruk paused in the filling of his glass i see he said quietly struggling to control his surging heart he set the decanter down slowly and with great concentration raised the goblet to his lips the liquid was cool on his tongue and its passage down his throat indeed calmed him well then he said turning what would your lord have of a peaceful alchemistcrones chipped beak opened in what baruk realized was silent laughter the bird fixed a single glittering eye on him your answer rode the very breath of your words lord peace my lord wishes to speak with you he wishes to come here this very night within the hourand youre to await my answeronly if you decide quickly lord i have things to do after all im more than a simple messagebearer those who know wisdom when they hear it hold me dear i am crone eldest of the moons great ravens whose eyes have looked upon a thousand years of human folly hence my tattered coat and broken beak as evidence of your indiscriminate destruction i am but a winged witness to your eternal madnessin quiet mockery baruk said more than just a witness its well known how you and your kind feasted on the plain outside pales wallsyet we were not the first to feast on flesh and blood lord lest you forgetbaruk turned away far be it for me to defend my species he muttered more to himself than to crone whose words had stung him his eyes fell on the shards of glass littering the floor he voiced a mending spell and watched as they reassembled i will speak with your lord crone he nodded as the glass pane rose from the floor and returned to the windowframe tell me will he as easily disdain my wards as you didmy lord is possessed of honour and courtesy crone replied ambiguously i shall call him thendo so baruk said sipping his wine an avenue will be provided for his passagethere came a knock at the dooryesroald stepped inside someone is at the gate wishing to speak with you the whitehaired servant said setting down a plate heaped with roast porkbaruk glanced at crone and raised an eyebrowthe bird ruffled her feathers your guest is mundane a restless personage whose thoughts are thick with greed and treachery a demon crouches on his shoulder named ambitionhis name roald baruk askedthe servant hesitated his soft eyes flicked uneasily at the bird now ambling towards the foodbaruk laughed my wise guests counsel indicates she well knows the mans name speak on roaldcouncilman turban orri would remain for this crone said if you would seek my counselplease do and yes i would the alchemist repliedi am no more than a pet dog the great raven crooned slyly anticipating his next question to the councilmans eyes that is my words a beasts whimper to his ears she speared a piece of meat and swallowed it quicklybaruk found himself beginning to like this mangy old witch of a birdbring the councilman to us roaldthe servant departedarchaic torches lit an estates highwalled garden with a flickering light that threw wavering shadows across the pavestones as a nightwind swept in from the lake rustling leaves the shadows danced like imps on the second floor of the building was a balcony overlooking the gardenbehind the curtained window two figures movedrallick nom lay prone on the garden wall in a niche of darkness beneath the estates gabled cornice he studied the feminine silhouette with the patience of a snake it was the fifth night in a row that he had occupied his hidden vantagepoint the lady sinitals lovers numbered as many but he had identified two in particular worthy of attentionboth were city councilmenthe glass door opened and a figure walked out on to the balconyrallick smiled as he recognized councilman lim the assassin shifted position slightly slipping one gloved hand under the stock of his crossbow reaching up with the other to swing back the oiled crank his eyes on the man leaning against the balcony railing across from him rallick carefully inserted a quarrel a glance down at the bolts iron head reassured himthe poison glittered wetly along the razorsharp edges returning his attention to the balcony he saw that lady sinital had joined limno wonder theres no shortage of lovers for that one rallick thought his eyes narrowing in study her black hair now unpinned flowed down sleek and shiny to the small of her back she wore a gauzethin nightdress and with the lamps of the room behind her her bodys round curves were clearly visibleas they spoke their voices carried to where rallick lay hiddenwhy the alchemist lady sinital was asking evidently resuming a conversation begun inside a fat old man smelling of sulphur and brimstone hardly suggestive of political power not even a council member is helim laughed softly your naivete is a charm lady a charmsinital pulled back from the railing and crossed her arms educate me then her words came sharp tightly bridledlim shrugged we have naught but suspicions lady but it is the wise wolf that follows every spoor no matter how slight the alchemist would have people think as you do a doddering old fool lim paused as if in thought perhaps weighing how much he should reveal we have sources he continued cautiously among the magery they inform us of one certain fact heavy with implications a good many of the wizards in the city fear the alchemist and they name him by a titlethat alone suggests a secret cabal of some sort a gathering of sorcerers lady is a fell thinglady sinital had returned to the councilmans side both now leaned on the railing studying the dark garden below the woman was silent for a time then she said he has council tiesif he has the evidence is buried deep lim flashed a grin and if he hasnt then that might changethis very nightpolitics rallick snarled silently and power the bitch spreads her legs to the council offering a vice few can ignore rallicks hands twitchedhe would kill this night not a contract the guild had no part in thisthe vendetta was personal she was gathering power around her insulating herself and rallick thought he understood why the ghosts of betrayal would not leave her alonepatience he reminded himself as he took aim for the last two years the life of lady sinital had been one of indolence the riches she had stolen had served to whet her every greed and the prestige as sole owner of the estate had done much to grease the hinges of her bedroom doorthe crime shed committed had not been against rallick but unlike her victim rallick had no pride to halt vengeancepatience rallick repeated his lips moving to the word as he sighted down the crossbows length a quality defined by its reward and that reward was but moments awaya fine looking hound councilman turban orr said as he handed roald his cloakin the room baruk was the only one capable of discerning the aura of illusion surrounding the black hunting dog lying curled on the rug before the fireplace the alchemist smiled and gestured to a chair please be seated councilmani apologize for disturbing you so late at night orr said as he lowered himself into the plush chair baruk sat down opposite him crone between them its said orr continued that alchemy flowers best in deep darknesshence you gambled on my being awake baruk said a wellplaced wager councilman now what would you have of meorr reached down to pat crones headbaruk looked away to keep himself from laughingthe council votes in two days orr said with a proclamation of neutrality such as we seek war with the malazan empire will be avertedso we believe but there are those in the council who do not pride has made them belligerent unreasonableas it does us all murmured barukorr leaned forward the support of darujhistans sorcerers would do much to favour our cause he saidcareful crone rumbled this man now hunts in earnestorr glanced down at the doga bad leg baruk said pay it no mind the alchemist leaned back in his chair and plucked at a loose thread on his robe i admit to some confusion councilman you appear to be assuming some things i cannot countenance baruk spread his hands and met orrs eyes darujhistans sorcerers for one you could travel the ten worlds and not find a more spiteful rabid collection of humanity i dont suggest that they are all like thisthere are those whose only interest indeed obsession lies in the pursuit of their craft their noses have been buried in books so long they could not even tell you what century this is the others find bickering their only true pleasure in lifea smile had come to orrs thin lips as baruk spoke but he said with a cunning gleam in his dark eyes there is one thing they all acknowledgeoh what is that councilmanpower were all aware of your eminence among the citys mages baruk your word alone would bring othersim flattered that you would think so baruk replied unfortunately therein lies your second erroneous assumption even if i had such influence as you suggest crone snorted and baruk flicked a savage glare at her then continued which i do not for what possible reason would i support such a wilfully ignorant position as yours a proclamation of neutrality might as well whistle against the wind councilman what purpose would it serveorrs smile had tightened surely lord he purred you have no wish to share the same fate as the wizards of palebaruk frowned what do you meanassassinated by an empire claw moons dawn was entirely on its own against the emnireyour information contradicts mine baruk said stiffly then cursed himselflean not too heavily on this one crone said smugly you are both wrongorrs eyebrows had risen at baruks words indeed perhaps it might profit us both to share our informationunlikely baruk said throwing the threat of the empire at me implies what that if the proclamation is voted down the citys sorcerers will all die at the empires hand but if it wins youre free to justify opening the gates to the malazans in peaceful coexistence and in such a scenario the citys magery lives onastute lord crone saidbaruk studied the anger now visible beneath orrs expressionneutrality how youve managed to twist that word your proclamation serves the first step towards total annexation councilman fortunate for you that i cast no weight no vote no influence baruk rose roald will see you outturban orr also rose youve made a grave error he saidthe proclamations wording is not yet complete it seems we would do well to remove any consideration regarding darujhistans magerytoo bold crone observed prod him and see what more comes forthbaruk strode towards the window one may only hope he said drily over a shoulder that your vote fails to win the dayorrs reply was hot and rushed by my count weve reached a majority this very night alchemist you could have provided the honey on the cream alas he sneered well win by only one vote but that will sufficebaruk turned to face orr as roald quietly entered the room bearing the councilmans cloakcrone stretched out on the rug on this night of all nights she said in mock dismay to tempt myriad fates with such words the great raven cocked her head faintly as from a great distance she thought she could hear the spinning of a cointhere was a tremble of power coming from somewhere within the city and crone shiveredrallick nom waited no more indolence for the lady sinital the end of such luxuries came this night the two figures moved away from the railing and faced the glass door rallicks finger tightened on the triggerhe froze a whirring spinning sound filled his head whispering words that left him bathed in sudden sweat all at once everything shifted turned over in his mind his plan for quick vengeance tumbled into disarray and from the ruins arose something far more elaborateall this had come between breaths rallicks gaze cleared lady sinital and councilman lim stood at the door the woman reached out to slide the panel to one side rallick swerved his crossbow an inch to the left then squeezed the trigger the blackened iron rib of the bow bucked with the release of tension the quarrel sped outward so fast as to be invisible until it hit homea figure on the balcony spun with the quarrels impact arms thrown out as it stumbled the glass door shattered as the figure fell through itlady sinital screamed in horrorrallick waited no longer rolling on to his back he reached up and slid the crossbow into the narrow ledge between the cornice and the roofthen he slipped down the outside of the wall hung with his hands briefly as shouts of alarm filled the estate a moment later he dropped spinning as he fell and landed catlike in the alleythe assassin straightened adjusted his cloak then calmly walked into the sidestreet away from the estate no more indolence for the lady sinital but no quick demise either a very powerful very wellrespected member of the city council had just been assassinated on her balconylims wifenow widowwould certainly have something to say about this the first phase rallick told himself as he strode through ossercs gate and descended the wide ramp leading down into the daru district just the first phase an opening gambit a hint to lady sinital that a hunt has begun with the eminent mistress herself as the quarry it wont be easy the womans no slouch in the intrigue gametherell be more blood he whispered aloud as he turned a corner and approached the poorly lit entrance to the phoenix inn but in the end shell fall and with that fall an old friend will rise as he neared the inn a figure stepped from the shadows of an adjacent alleyway raffick stopped the figure gestured then stepped back into the darknessrallick followed in the alley he waited for his eyes to adjustthe man in front of him sighed your vendetta probably saved your life tonight he said his tone bitterrallick leaned against a wall and crossed his arms ohclan leader ocelot stepped close his narrow pitted face twisted into its habitual scowl the nights been a shambles nom youve heard nothingnoocelots thin lips curled into a humourless smile a war has begun on the rooftops someone is killing us we lost five roamers in less than an hour meaning theres more than one killer out thereundoubtedly rallick replied fidgeting as the damp stones of the inns wall reached through his cloak and touched his flesh with chill as always guild affairs bored himocelot continued we lost that bull of a man talo krafar and a clan leader the man snapped a glance over his shoulder as if expecting a sudden dagger to come flashing at his own backdespite his lack of interest rallicks eyebrows lifted at this last bit of news they must be goodgood all of our eyewitnesses are dead goes the sour joke this night they dont make mistakes the bastardseveryone makes mistakes rallick muttered has vorcan gone outocelot shook his head not yet shes too busy recalling all the clansrallick frowned curious in spite of himself could this be a challenge to her guild mastery perhaps an inside thing a factionyou think were all fools dont you nom that was vorcans first suspicion no its not internal whoevers killing our people is from outside the guild outside the cityto rallick the answer seemed obvious suddenly and he shrugged an empire claw thenthough his expression bore reluctance ocelot nevertheless acknowledged agreement likely he grated theyre supposed to be the best arent they but why go after the guild youd think theyd be taking out the noblesare you asking me to guess the empires intentions ocelotthe clan leader blinked then his scowl deepened i came to warn you and thats a favour nom with you wrapped up in this vendetta thing the guilds not obliged to spread its wing over you a favourrallick pushed himself from the wall and turned to the alleymoutha favour ocelot he laughed softlywere setting a trap ocelot said moving to block rallicks way he jerked his scarred chin at the phoenix inn make yourself visible and leave no doubt as to what you do for a livingrallicks gaze on ocelot held steady impassive baitjust do itwithout replying rallick left the alley climbed the steps and entered the phoenix innthere is a shaping in the night crone said after turban orr had leftthe air around her shimmered as she assumed her true shapebaruk strode to his map table hands clasped behind his back to still the trembling that had seized them you felt it too then he paused then sighed all in all these seem the busiest hoursa convergence of power ever yields thus crone said as she rose to stretch her wings the black winds gather alchemist beware their flaying breathbaruk grunted while you ride them a harbinger of our tragic illscrone laughed she waddled to the window my master comes ive other tasks before mebaruk turned permit me he said gesturing the window swung clearcrone flapped up on to the sill she swivelled her head round and cocked an eye at baruk i see twelve ships riding a deep harbour she said eleven stand tall in flamesbaruk stiffened he had not anticipated a prophecy now he was afraid and the twelfth he asked his voice barely a whisper on the wind a hailstorm of sparks fill the night sky i see them spinning spinning about the last vessel crone paused still spinning then she was gonebaruks shoulders slumped he turned back to the map on the table and studied the eleven once free cities that now bore the empire flagonly darujhistan remained the twelfth and last marked by a flag that was not burgundy and grey the passing of freedom he murmuredsuddenly the walls around him groaned and baruk gasped as an enormous weight seemed to press down on him the blood pounded in his head lancing him with pain he gripped the edge of the map table to steady himself the incandescent globes of light suspended from the ceiling dimmed then flickered out in the darkness the alchemist heard cracks sweeping down the walls as if a giants hand had descended on the building all at once the pressure vanished baruk raised a shaking hand to his sweatslicked browa soft voice spoke behind him greetings high alchemist i am the lord of moons spawnstill facing the table baruk closed his eyes and nodded the title isnt necessary he whispered please call me barukim at home in darkness the lord said will this prove an inconvenience barukthe alchemist muttered a spell before him the details of the map on the table took on distinction emanating a cool blue glow he faced the lord and was startled to discover that the tall cloaked figure reflected as little heat as the rooms inanimate objects nevertheless he was able to distinguish quite clearly the mans features youre tiste and he saidthe lord bowed slightly his angled multihued eyes scanned the room have you any wine barukof course lord the alchemist walked over to his deskmy name as best as it can be pronounced by humans is anomander rake the lord followed baruk to the desk his boots clicking on the polished marble floorbaruk poured wine then turned to study rake with some curiosity he had heard that tiste and warriors were fighting the empire up north commanded by a savage beast of a man named caladan brood they had allied with the crimson guard and together the two forces were decimating the malazans so there were tiste and in moons spawn and the man standing before him was their lordthis moment marked the first time baruk had ever seen a tiste and face to face he was more than a little disturbed such remarkable eyes he thought one moment a deep hue of amber catlike and unnerving the next grey and banded like a snakesa fell rainbow of colours to match any mood he wondered if they were capable of lyingin the alchemists library lay copies of the surviving tomes of gothos folly jaghut writings from millennia past in them tiste and were mentioned here and there in an aura of fear baruk recalled gothos himself a jaghut wizard who had descended the deepest warrens of elder magic had praised the gods of the time that the tiste and were so few in number and if anything the mysterious blackskinned race had dwindled since thenanomander rakes skin was jetblack befitting gothos descriptions but his mane flowed silver he stood close to seven feet tall his features were sharp as if cut from onyx a slight upward tilt to the large verticalpupilled eyesa twohanded sword was strapped to rakes broad back its silver dragonskull pommel and archaic crosshilt jutting from a wooden scabbard fully six and a half feet long from the weapon bled power staining the air like black ink in a pool of water as his gaze rested on it baruk almost reeled seeing for a brief moment a vast darkness yawning before him cold as the heart of a glacier from which came the stench of antiquity and a faint groaning sound baruk wrenched his eyes from the weapon looked up to find rake studying him from over one shoulderthe tiste and quirked a knowing smile then handed baruk one of the winefilled goblets was crone her usual melodramatic selfbaruk blinked then could not help but grinrake sipped his wine shes never been modest in displaying her talents shall we sitof course baruk replied relaxing in spite of his trepidation from his years of study the alchemist knew that great power shaped different souls differently had rakes been twisted baruk would have known immediately but the lords control seemed absolute that alone engendered awe the man shaped his power not the other way aroundsuch control was well inhuman he suspected that this would not be the first insight hed have regarding this warriormage that would leave him astonished and frightenedshe threw everything she had at me rake said suddenly the tiste and s eyes shone green as glacial icestartled by the vehemence of that outburst baruk frowned she oh the empress of courseand even then rake continued she couldnt bring me downthe alchemist stiffened in his chair yet he said cautiously you were driven back battered and beaten i can feel your power anomander rake he added grimacing it pulses from you like waves so i must ask how is it you were defeated i know something of the empires high mage tayschrenn he has power but its no match to yours so again i ask howhis gaze on the map table rake replied ive committed my sorcerers and warriors to broods north campaign he turned a humourless grin on baruk within my city are children priests and three elderly exceedingly bookish warlockscity there was a city within moons spawna dun tone had entered rakes eyes i cannot defend an entire moon i cannot be everywhere at once and as for tayschrenn he didnt give a damn about the people around him i thought to dissuade him make the price too high he shook his head as if perplexed then he looked to baruk to save the home of my people i retreatedleaving pale to fall baruk shut his mouth cursing his lack of tactbut rake merely shrugged i didnt anticipate that id face a full assault my presence alone had been keeping the empire at bay for almost two yearsive heard the empress is short of patience murmured baruk thoughtfully his eyes narrowed then he looked up you have asked to meet with me anomander rake and so here we are what is it you wish from mean alliance the moons lord answeredwith me personallyno games baruk rakes voice was suddenly cold im not fooled by that council of idiots bickering at majesty hall i know that its you and your fellow mages who rule darujhistan he rose and glared down with eyes of grey ill tell you this for the empress your city is the lone pearl on this continent of mud she wants it and what she wants she usually getsbaruk reached down and plucked at the frayed edge of his robe i see he said in a low voice pale had its wizardsrake frowned indeedyet baruk continued when the battle was begun in earnest your first thought was not for the alliance you made with the city but for the wellbeing of your moonwho told you this rake demandedbaruk looked up and raised both hands some of those wizards managed to escapetheyre in the city rakes eyes had gone blackseeing them baruk felt sweat break out beneath his clothes why he askedi want their heads rake replied casually he refilled his goblet and took a sipan icy hand had slipped around baruks heart and was now tightening his headache had increased tenfold in the last few seconds whyhe asked again the word coming out almost as a gaspif the tiste and knew of the alchemists sudden discomfort he made no sign of it why he seemed to roll the word in his mouth like wine a light smile touching his lips when the moranth army came down from the mountains and tayschrenn rode at the head of his wizard cadre and when word spread that an empire claw had infiltrated the city rakes smile twisted into a snarl the wizards of pale fled he paused as if reliving memories i dispatched the claw when they were but a dozen steps inside the walls he paused again his face betraying a flash of regret had the citys wizards remained the assault would have been repelled tayschrenn it seemed was preoccupied with other imperatives hed saturated his positiona hilltopwith defensive wards then he unleashed demons not against me but against some of his companions that baffled me but rather than allow such conjurings to wander at will i expended vital power destroying them he sighed and said i pulled the moon back mere minutes from its destruction i left it to drift south and went after those wizardsafter themi tracked down all but two rake gazed at baruk i want those two preferably alive but their heads will sufficeyou killed those you found howwith my sword of coursebaruk recoiled as if struck oh he whispered ohthe alliance rake said before draining his gobletill speak to the cabal on this matter baruk answered rising shakily to his feet word of the decision will be sent to you soon he stared at the sword strapped to the tiste and s back tell me if you get those wizards alive will you use that on themrake frowned of courseturning away baruk closed his eyes youll have their heads thenbehind him rake laughed harshly theres too much mercy in your heart alchemistthe pale light beyond the window signified the dawn within the phoenix inn only one table remained occupied around it sat four men one asleep in his chair with his head lying in a pool of stale beer he snored loudly the others were playing cards two redeyed with exhaustion while the last one studied his hand and talked and talkedand then there was the time i saved rallick noms life at the back of all eves street four no five nefarious hoodlums had backed the boy to a wall he was barely standing was rallick gushing blood from a hundred knife wounds clear to me was the grim fact that it couldnt last much longer that tussle i come up on them six assassins from behind old kruppe with fire dancing on his fingertipsa magical spell of frightful violence i uttered the cantrip in a single breath and lo six piles of ash at rallicks feet six piles of ash aglitter with the coin from their walletshah a worthy rewardmurillio leaned his long elegant frame close to crokus younghand is this possible he whispered for a turn to last as long as kruppescrokus grinned wearily at his friend i dont mind really its safe in here and thats what counts for meassassins war bosh kruppe said leaning back to mop his brow with a wilted silk handkerchief kruppe remains entirely unconvinced tell me did you not see rallick nom in here earlier spoke long with murillio here the lad did as calm as ever was he notmurillio grimaced nom gets like that every time hes just killed somebody lay down a card dammit ive early appointments to attend tocrokus asked so what was rallick talking to you aboutmurillios answer was a mere shrug he continued glaring at kruppethe small mans pencilthin eyebrows rose is it kruppes turnclosing his eyes crokus slumped in his chair he groaned i saw three assassins on the rooftops kruppe and the two that killed the third went after me even though its obvious im no assassinwell said murillio eyeing the young thiefs tattered clothing and the cuts and scrapes on his face and hands im inclined to believe youfools kruppe sits at a table of fools kruppe glanced down at the snoring man and coll here is the biggest of them all but sadly gifted with selfknowledge hence his present state from which many profane truths might be drawn appointments murillio kruppe didnt think the citys multitude of mistresses awoke so early in the day after all what might they see in their mirrors kruppe shivers at the thoughtcrokus massaged the bruise hidden beneath his long brown hair he winced then leaned forward come on kruppe he muttered play a cardmy turnseems selfknowledge doesnt extend to whose turn it is murillio commented drilyboots sounded on the stairs the three turned to see rallick nom descending from the first floor the tall darkskinned man looked restedhe wore his day cloak a deep royal purple clasped at the neck by a silver clamshell brooch his black hair was freshly braided framing his narrow cleanshaven face raffick walked up to the table and reached down to grasp colls thinning hair he raised the mans head from the pool of beer and bent forward to study colls blotched face then he gently set down the mans head and pulled up a chairis this the same game as last nightof course kruppe replied kruppe has these two men backed to the very wall in danger of losing their very shirts its good to see you again friend rallick the lad here kruppe indicated crokus with a limp hand fingers fluttering speaks endlessly of murder above our heads a veritable downpour of blood have you ever heard such nonsense rallick kruppes friendrallick shrugged another rumour this city was built on rumourscrokus scowled to himself it seemed that no one was willing to answer questions this morning he wondered yet again what the assassin and murillio had been talking about earlier hunched as theyd been over a dimly lit table in one corner of the room crokus had suspected some sort of conspiracy not that such a thing was unusual for them though most times kruppe was at its centremurillio swung his gaze to the bar sulty he called out you awakethere was a mumbled response from behind the wooden counter the sulty her blonde hair dishevelled and plump face looking plumper stood up yah she mumbled whatbreakfast for my friends here if you please murillio climbed to his feet and cast a critical obviously disapproving eye over his clothing the soft billowing shirt dyed a bright green now hung on his lanky frame wilted and beerstained his fine tanned leather pantaloons were crease and patchy sighing murillio stepped away from the table i must bath and change as for the game i surrender consumed by hopelessness kruppe i now believe will never play his card thus leaving us trapped in the unlikely world of his recollections and reminiscences potentially for ever goodnight one and all he and rallick locked gazes the murillio gave a faint nodcrokus witnessed the exchange and his scowl deepened he watched murillio leave then glanced at rallick the assassin sat staring down a coll his expression as unreadable as eversulty wandered into the kitchen and a moment later the clanking of pots echoed into the roomcrokus tossed his cards into the tables centre and leaned back closing his eyesdoes the lad surrender as well kruppe askedcrokus noddedhah kruppe remains undefeated he set down his cards and tucked in a napkin at his thick jiggling neckin the thiefs mind suspicions of intrigue ran wild first the assassins war now rallick and murillio had something cooking he sighed mentally and opened his eyes his whole body ached from the nights adventures but he knew hed been lucky he stared down at coll without seeing him the vision of those tall black assassins returned to him and he shiveredyet for all the dangers hounding his back up on the rooftops this past night he had to admit how exciting itd all been after slamming that door behind him and quaffing the beer sulty had thrust into his hand his whole body had trembled for an hour afterwardshis gaze focused on coll coll kruppe murillio and rallick what a strange groupa drunkard an obese mage of dubious abilities a dandified fop and a killerstill they were his best friends his parents had succumbed to the winged plague when hed been four years old since then his uncle mammot had raised him the old scholar had done the best he could but it hadnt been enough crokus found the streets shadows and moonless nights on rooftops far more exciting than his uncles mouldy booksnow however he felt very much alone kruppes mask of blissful idiocy never dropped not even for an instantall through the years when crokus had been apprenticed to the fat man in the art of thievery hed never seen kruppe act otherwise colls life seemed to involve the relentless avoidance of sobriety for reasons unknown to crokusthough he suspected that once coll had been something more and now rallick and murillio had counted him out of some new intrigueinto his thoughts came an imagethe moonlit limbs of a sleeping maidenand he angrily shook his headsulty arrived with breakfast husks of bread fried in butter a chunk of goat cheese a stem of local grapes and a pot of callows bitter coffee she served crokus first and he muttered his thankskruppes impatience grew while sulty served rallick such impertinence the man said adjusting his coats wide stained sleeveskruppe is of a mind to cast a thousand horrible spells on rude sultykruppe had better not rallick saidoh no of course not kruppe amended wiping his brow with his handkerchief a wizard of my skills would never belittle himself on a mere scullion after allsulty turned to him scullion she snatched a bread husk from the plate and slapped it down on kruppes head dont worry she said as she walked back to the bar with hair like yours nobodyd noticekruppe pulled the husk from his head he was about to toss it down on the floor then changed his mind he licked his lips kruppe is magnanimous this morning he said breaking into a wide smile and setting the bread down on his plate he leaned forward and laced together his pudgy fingers kruppe wishes to begin his meal with some grapes pleasechapter seveni see a man crouched in a fire who leaves me cold and wondering what he is doing here so boldly crouched in my pyregadrobi epitaph anonymousthis time kruppes dream took him out through marsh gap along south road then left on to cutter lake road overhead the sky swirled a most unpleasant pattern of silver and pale green all is in flux kruppe gasped his feet hurrying him along the dust barren road the coin has entered a childs possession though it knows it not is it for kruppe to walk this monkey road fortunatetly kruppes perfectly round body is an example of perfect symmetry one not only born skilled at said balance one must learn it through arduos practice of course kruppe is unique in never requiring practice in anythingoff in the fields to his left within a circle of young trees a small fire cast a hazy red glow up among the budding branches kruppes sharp eye could make out a single figure seated there seemingly holding its hands the flames too many stones to turn underfoot he gasped on this rock rutted road kruppe would try the ribbed earth which is yet too green with the seasons growth indeed yon fire beckons he left the road at approached the circle of treesas he strode between two slim boles and stepped into the pool of light the hooded figure turned slowly to study him its face hidden in shadow despite the fire before it though it held its hands in the flame they withstood the heat the long sinuous fingers spread widei would partake of this warmth kruppe said with a slight bow so rare within kruppes dreams of latestrangers wander through them the figure said in a thin oddly accented voice such as i have you summoned me then it has been a long time since i walked on soilkruppes brows rose summoned nay not kruppe who is also a victim of his dreams imagine after all that kruppe sleeps even now beneath warm blankets secure in his humble room yet see me stranger for i am cold nay chilledthe other laughed softly and beckoned kruppe to the fire i seek sensation once again it said but my hands feel nothing to be worshipped is to share the supplicants pain i fear my followers are no morekruppe was silent he did not like the sombre mood of this dream he held his hands before the fire yet felt little heat a chill ache had settled into his knees finally he looked over the flames to the hooded figure opposite him kruppe thinks you are an elder god have you a namei am known as krulkruppe stiffened his guess had been correct the thought of an elder god awakened and wandering through his dreams sent his thoughts scampering like frightened rabbits how have you come to be here krul he asked a tremor in his voice all at once this place seemed too hot he pulled his handkerchief from his sleeve and mopped sweat from his browkrul considered before answering and kruppe heard doubt in his voice blood has been spilled behind the walls of this glowing city kruppe upon stone once holy in my name thisthis is new to meonce i reigned in the minds of many mortals and they fed me well with blood and split bones long before the first towers of stone rose to mortal whims i walked among hunters the hood tilted upward and kruppe felt immortal eyes fixing upon him blood has been spilled again but that alone is not enough i believe i am here to await one who will be awakened one i have known before long agokruppe digested this like sour bile and what do you bring kruppethe elder god rose abruptly an ancient fire that will give you warmth in times of need he said but i hold you to nothing seek the tlan imass who will lead the woman they are the awakeners i must prepare for battle i think one i will losekruppes eyes widened with sudden comprehension you are being used he breathedperhaps if so then the child gods have made a grave error after all a ghastly smile seemed to come into his tone i will lose a battle but i will not die krul turned away from the fire then his voice drifted back to kruppe play on mortal every god falls at a mortals hands such is the only end to immortalitythe elder gods wistfulness was not lost on kruppe he suspected that a great truth had been revealed to him with those final words a truth he was now given leave to use and use it kruppe shall he whisperedthe elder god had left the pool of light heading northeast across the fields kruppe stared at the fire it licked the wood hungrily but no ash was born and though unfed since hed arrived it did not dim he shiveredin the hands of a child he muttered this night kruppe is truly alone in the world alonean hour before dawn circle breaker was relieved of his vigil at despots barbican this night none had come to rendezvous beneath the gatelightning played among the jagged peaks of the tahlyn mountains to the north as the man walked in solitude down the winding charms of anise street in the spice quarter ahead and below glittered the lakefront the merchant trader ships from distant callows elingarth and keplers spite hunched dark and gloaming between gaslit stone piersa cool lake breeze carried to the man the smell of rain though overhead the stars glistened with startling clarity he had removed his tabard folding it into a small leather satchel now slung on one shoulder only the plain shortsword strapped at his hip marked him as a soldier yet a soldier without provenancehe had divested himself of his official duties and as he walked down towards the water the years of service seemed to slough from his spiritbright were the memories of his childhood at these docks to which he had been ever drawn by the allure of the strange traders as they swung into their berths like weary and weathered heroes returned from some elemental war in those days it was not uncommon to see the galleys of the freemen privateers ease into the bay sleek and riding low with bootythey hailed from such mysterious ports as filman orras fort by a half dead mans story and exile names that rang of adventure in the ears of a lad who had never seen his home city from outside its wallsthe man slowed as he reached the foot of the stone pier the years between him and that lad marched through his mind a possession of martial images growing ever grimmer if he searched out the many crossroads he had come to in the past he saw their skies stormwarped the lands ragged and windtorn the forces of age and experience worked on them now and whatever choices he had made then seemed fated and almost desperateis it only the young who know desperation he wondered as he moved to sit on the piers stone seawall before him rippled the bays sooty waters twenty feet below the rockstudded shore lay sheathed in darkness the glitter of broken glass and crockery here and there winking like starsthe man turned slightly to face the right his gaze travelled the slope there as it climbed to the summit on which loomed the squat bulk of majesty hall never reach too far a simple lesson of life he had learned long ago on the burning deck of a corsair its belly filling with the sea as it drifted outside the pinnacle fortifications of a city named broken jawhubris the scholars would call the fiery end of the freemen privateersnever reach too far the mans eyes held on majesty hall the deadlock that had come with the assassination of councilman lim still held within those walls the council raced aflurry in circles more precious hours spent on eager speculation and gossip than on the matters of stateturban orr his victory on the voting floor snatched from his hands in the last moment now flung his hounds down every trail seeking the spies he was convinced had infiltrated his nest the councilman was no fooloverhead a flock of grey gulls swept lakeward crying into the nightchilled air he drew a breath hunched his shoulders and pulled his gaze with an effort from majesty hilltoo late to concern himself about reaching too far since the day the eels agent had come to him the mans future was sealed to some it would be called treason and perhaps in the end it was treason who could say what lay in the eels mind even his principal agentthe mans contactprofessed ignorance of his masters planshis thoughts returned to turban orr hed set himself against a cunning man a man of power his only defence against orr lay in anonymity it wouldnt lasthe sat on the pier awaiting the eels agent and he would deliver into that mans hands a message for the eel how much would change with the delivery of that missive was it wrong for him to seek help to threaten his frail anonymitythe solitude that gave him so much inner strength that stiffened his own resolve yet to match wits with turban orrhe did not think he could do it alonethe man reached into his jerkin and withdrew the scroll a crossroads marked where he now stood he recognized that much in answer to his illmeasured fear hed written the plea for help on this scrollit would be an easy thing to do to surrender now he hefted the frail parchment in his hands feeling its slight weight the vague oiliness of the coating the rough weave of its tiestring an easy desperate thing to dothe man lifted his head the sky had begun to pale the lake wind picking up the days momentum there would be rain coming from the north as it often did at this time of year a cleansing of the city a freshening of its spiceladen breath he slipped the string from the scroll and unfurled the parchmentso easywith slow deliberate movements the man tore up the scroll he let the ragged pieces drift down scattering into the gloom of the lakes shadowed shore the rising waves swept them outward to dot the turgid swells like flecks of ashcoming from somewhere in the back of his mind he thought he heard a coin spinning it seemed a sad sounda few minutes later he left the pier the eels agent out on his morning stroll would in passing note his contacts absence and simply continue on his wayhe made his way along the lakefront street with the summit of majesty hill dwindling behind him as he passed the first of the silk merchants appeared laying out their wares on the wide paved walkamong the silks the man recognized the dyed lavender twists and bolts of illem the pale yellows of setta and lesttwo cities to the southeast he knew had been annexed by the pannion seer in the last monthand the heavy bold twists of sarrokalle a dwindled sampling all trade from the north had ended under malazan dominionhe turned from the lake at the entry to the scented wood and headed into the city four streets ahead his single room waited on the second floor of a decaying tenement grey and silent with the coming dawn its thin warped door latched and locked in that room he allowed no place for memories nothing to mark him in a wizards eye or tell the sharpwitted spyhunter details of his life in that room he remained anonymous even to himselfthe lady sinital paced these last few days too much of her hardwon gold had been spent smoothing the waters that damn bitch of lims had not let grief get in the way of her greed barely two days shrouded in black and then out on the courts hanging on that fop murillios arm smug as a tart at a ballsinitals pencilled brows knitted slightly murillio that young man had a way of being seen he might be worth cultivation all things consideredshe stopped pacing and faced the man sprawled on her bed so youve learned nothing a hint of contempt had slipped into her tone and she wondered if hed caught itcouncilman turban orr his heavily scarred forearm covering his eyes did not move as he replied ive told you all this theres no knowing where that poisoned quarrel came from sinital hell poisoned what assassin uses poison these days vorcans got them so studded with magic everything else is obsoleteyoure digressing she said satisfied that hed missed the careless unveiling of her sentimentsits like i said orr continued lim was involved in more than one uh delicate venture the assassinations probably unconnected with you it could have been anyones balcony it just happened to be yourslady sinital crossed her arms i dont believe in coincidence turban tell me was it coincidence that his death broke your majoritythe night before the vote she saw the mans cheek twitch and knew shed stung him she smiled and moved to the bed she sat and ran a hand along his bared thigh in any case have you checked on him latelyhimsinital scowled withdrawing her hand and standing my beloved dispossessed you idiotturban orrs mouth curved into a smug smile i always keep a check on him for you my dear nothings changed in that area he hasnt sobered up since you threw him out on his arse the man sat up and reached to the bedpost where his clothes hung he began dressingsinital whirled to him what are you doing she demanded her voice stridentwhats it look like turban pulled on his breeches the debate rages on at majesty hall my influence is requiredto do what bend yet another councilman to your willhe slipped on his silk shirt still smiling that and other thingssinital rolled her eyes oh of coursethe spy id forgotten about himpersonally orr resumed i believe the proclamation of neutrality to the malazans will go throughperhaps tomorrow or the next dayshe laughed harshly neutrality youre beginning to believe your own propaganda what you want turban orr is power the naked absolute power that comes with being a malazan high fist you think this the first step to paving your road into the empresss arms at the jo citys expense but you dont give a damn about thatturban sneered up at sinital stay out of politics woman darujhistans fall to the empire is inevitable better a peaceful occupation than a violent onepeaceful are you blind to what happened to pales nobility oh the ravens feasted on delicate flesh for days this empire devours noble bloodwhat happened at pale isnt as simple as you make it turban said there was a moranth reckoning involved a clause in the alliance writ such culling will not occur hereand what if it does we could use it as far as im concerned his grin returned so much for your hear bleeding to the citys woes all that interests you is you save the righteous citizen offal for your fawns sinital he adjusted his leggings sinital stepped to the bedpost reaching down to touch the silve pommel of orrs duelling sword you should kill him and be done with it she saidback to him again the councilman laughed as he rose your brain works with all the subtlety of a malicious child he collected his sword and strapped it on its a wonder you wrested anything from that idiot husband of yoursyou were so evenly matched in matters of cunningthe easiest thing to break is a mans heart sinital said with a private smile she lay down on the bed stretching her arms and arching he back she said what about moons spawn its still just hanging there gazing down at her his eyes travelling along her body the councilman replied distractedly weve yet to work out a way to get a message up there weve set up a tent in its shadow and stationed representatives in it but that mysterious lord just ignores usmaybe hes dead sinital said relaxing with a sigh maybe the moons just sitting there because theres nobody left alive inside have you thought of that dear councilmanturban orr turned to the door we have ill see you tonighti want him killed sinital saidthe councilman reached for the latch maybe ill see you tonight he asked againmaybeturban orrs hand rested on the latch then he opened the door an left the roomlying on her bed lady sinital sighed her thoughts shifted to a certain dandy whose loss to a certain widow would be a most delicious coupmurillio sipped spiced wine the details are sketchy he said making a face as the fiery alcohol stung his lipsin the street below a brilliantly painted carriage clattered past draw by three white horses in black bridles the man gripping the reins was robed in black and hooded the horses tossed their heads ears pinned back and eyes rolling but the drivers broad veined hands held them in check on either side of the carriage walked middleaged women bronz cups sat on their shaved heads from which unfurled wavering streams of scented smokemurillio leaned against the railing and looked down upon the troupethe bitch fanders being carted out he said bloody grim rituals if you ask me he sat back in the plush chair and smiled at his companion raising the goblet the wolf goddess of winter dies her seasonal death on a carpet of white no less and in a weeks time the gedderone fte fills the streets with flowers soon to clog gutters and block drains throughout the citythe young woman across from him smiled her eyes on her own goblet of wine which she held in both hands like an offering which details were you referring to she asked glancing up at him brieflydetailsshe smiled faintly the sketchy onesoh murillio waved one gloved hand dismissively lady sinitals version held that councilman lim had come in person to acknowledge her formal invitationinvitation do you mean to the festive shes throwing on gedderones evemurillio blinked of course surely your house has been invitedoh yes and youalas no murillio said smilingtfw xxtnmnn  silent her eyelids lowering in thought murillio glanced back to the street below he waited such things after all moved of their own accord and even he could not guess the pace or track of a womans thoughts especially when it had to do with sex and this was most assuredly a play for favoursmurillios best game and he always played it through never disappoint them that was the key the closestheld secret is the one that never sours with agefew of the other tables on the balcony were occupied the establishments noble patrons preferring the scented airs of the dining room within murillio found comfort in the buzzing life of the streets and he knew his guest did tooat least in this instance with all the noise rising from below their chances of being overheard were slightas his gaze wandered aimlessly along moruls street of jewels he stiffened slightly eyes widening as they focused on a figure standing in a doorway opposite him he shifted in his seat dropping his left hand past the stone railing out of the womans sight then he jerked it repeatedly glaring down at the figurerallick noms smile broadened he stepped away from the doorway and strolled up the street pausing to inspect an array of pearls laid out on an ebony table in front of a store the proprietor took a nervous step forward then relaxed as rallick moved onmurillio sighed leaning back and taking a mouthful of liquor idiotthe mans face his hands his walk his eyes all said one thing killerhell even his wardrobe had all the warmth and vitality of an executioners uniformwhen it came to subtlety rallick nom was sorely lacking which made this whole thing rather odd that such a complex scheme could have been born from the assassins rigidly geometric brain still whatever its origins it was pure geniusdo you dearly wish to attend murillio the woman askedmurillio smiled his warmest smile he looked away its a large estate isnt itlady sinitals indeed fraught with rooms the woman dipped one dainty finger into the pungent fiery liquid then raised it to her lips inserting it into her mouth as if in afterthought she continued studying the goblet in her other hand i would expect a good many of the servants quarters though lacking in the simplest needs of luxury will remain empty for much of the nightno clearer invitation did murillio require rallicks plan centred on this very moment and its consequences still adultery had one drawback murillio had no desire to meet this womans husband on the duelling piste he drove such disturbing thoughts away with another mouthful of wine i would love to attend the ladys festival on one condition he looked up and locked gazes with the woman that you will grace me with your company that nightfor an hour or two that is his brow assumed a troubled furrow i would not wish to impinge on your husbands claim on you of course which is exactly what he would be doing and they both knew itof course the woman replied suddenly coy that would be unseemly how many invitations do you require two he said best that i be seen with a companionyes its bestmurillio glanced down at his now empty goblet with a rueful expression then he sighed alas i must be taking my leavei admire your selfdiscipline the woman saidyou wont on gedderones eve murillio answered silently as he rose from his chair the lady of chance has graced me with this meeting of ours he said bowing until the eve lady orruntil then the councilmans wife answered seeming already to lose interest in him goodbyemurillio bowed again then left the balcony among the crowded tables more than a few noblewomens heavylidded eyes watched him leavemoruls street of jewels ended at sickle gate rallick felt the wide eyes of the two guards beside the ramp following him as he passed through the passage between the massive stones of the third tier wall ocelot had told him to make it plain and while murillio was of the opinion that only a blind man could ever mistake him for anything other than a killer rallick had taken pains to achieve the obviousthe guards did nothing of course giving the appearance of being a murderer wasnt the same as being one in truth the citys laws were strict in such things he knew he might find himself being followed as he strode down the opulent streets of higher estates but hed leave them to it making no effort to lose them darujhistans nobles paid good money to loose spies on to the streets day after day might as well make them earn their breadrallick had no sympathy for them he did not however share the commoners hatred for the nobility their constant airs prickly honours and endless squabbles made for good business after allwhen the malazan empire came that would end he suspected in the empire assassin guilds were illegal and those of the trade who were deemed worthy were enlisted into the secret ranks of the claw as for those who werent considered worthy they simply disappeared the nobles didnt fare much better if the rumours from pale held any truthit would be a different world when the empire came and rallick wasnt sure he wanted to be part of itstill there were things left to achieve he wondered if murillio had succeeded in getting the invitations everything hinged on that thered been a longdrawnout argument about it the night before murillio preferred widows adultery had never been his style but rallick had remained insistent and finally murillio had given inthe assassin still wondered about his friends reluctance his first thought was that murillio feared the possibility of a duel with turban orr but murillio was no slouch with a rapier rallick had practised with him in secluded places enough times to suspect that he was an adeptand to that even turban orr could not make claimno it wasnt fear that made murillio shy from this part of the plan it dawned on rallick that there was a moral issue at stake a whole new side of murillio had revealed itself to rallick thenhe was pondering the implications when his gaze found a familiar face among the streets crowd he stopped and studied the surrounding buildings and his eyes widened as he realized where his wanderings had taken him his attention snapped back to the familiar figure appearing every few moments on the streets opposite side the assassins eyes narrowed thoughtfullybeneath the midmornings blue and silver hue crokus walked along lakefront street surrounded by the bedlam of merchants and shoppersa dozen streets ahead rose the city hills beyond the third tier wall on the easternmost hill stood the krul belfry its greenpatched bronze scales glimmering in the suns lightto his mind the tower challenged majesty halls bright mien gazing over the estates and buildings crouched on the lower hills with its rheumed eyes and historyscarred facea jaded cast to its mocking gleamcrokus shared something of the towers imagined sardonic reserve for the pretence so rife in majesty hall an emotion of his uncles that had seeped into the lad over the years adding fuel to this fire was a healthy dose of youthful resentment towards anything that smacked of authorityand though he gave it little thought these provided the primary impulses for his thieving activities yet hed never before understood the most subtle and hurtful insult his thefts deliveredthe invasion and violation of privacy again and again in his dreamy wanderings both day and night the vision of the young woman asleep in her bed returned to himeventually crokus grasped that the vision had everything to do with everything hed come into her room a place where the noble brats drooling at her heels couldnt enter a place where she might talk to the ragged dolls of her childhood when innocence didnt just mean a flower not yet plucked her sanctuary and hed despoiled it hed snatched from this young woman her most precious possession her privacyno matter that she was the daughter of the darles that she was born to the pure blooduntainted by the lady of beggars touchthat she would flow through life protected and shielded from the degradations of the real world no matter any of these things for crokus his crime against her was tantamount to rape to have so boldly shattered her worldhis thoughts a storm of selfrecrimination the young thief turned up the charms of anise street pushing through the crowdsin his mind the oncestalwart walls of righteous outrage were crumbling the hated nobility had shown him a face that now haunted him with its beauty and tugged him in a hundred unexpected directionsthe sweet scents of the spice stores wafting like perfume on the warming breeze had unaccountably lodged a nameless emotion in his throatthe shouts of daru children playing in the alleys brimmed his eyes wh sentimental maunderingcrokus strode through clove gate and entered osserc narrowdirectly ahead rose the ramp leading into higher estates as he approached he had to move quickly to one side to avoid a large carriage coming up on him from behind he didnt need to see the crest adorning the carriages side panel to recognize its house the horses snapped and kicked surging forward heedless of anyone or anything in their pathcrokus paused to watch the carriage clatter up the ramp people scattering to either side from what hed heard of councilman turban orr it seemed the duellists horses matched his contempt for those he supposedly servedby the time he reached the orr estate the carriage had already passed through the outer gate four burly private guards had resumed their station to either side the wall at their backs rose a full fifteen feet topped with rusty iron cuttings set in sunbaked clay pumice torches lined the wall at tenfoot intervals crokus strolled past the gate ignoring the guards at the base the wall looked to be about four feet in breadth the roughhewn bricks a standard squared foot he continued on along the street then turned right to check the wall fronting the alleya single service door tarred oak banded in bronze was set in this wall at the nearest cornerand no guard the shadows of the opposite estate draped a heavy cloak across the narrow aisle crokus entered the damp musty darknesshe had travelled half the length of the alley when a hand closed around his mouth from behind and a daggers sharp point pressed against his side crokus froze then grunted as the hand pulled his face round he found himself looking into familiar eyesrallick nom withdrew his dagger and stepped back a severe frown marring his brow crokus gaped then licked his lips rallick berus heart you scared megood the assassin said he came close listen carefully crokusyoull not try orrs estate youll not go near it againthe thief shrugged it was just a thought nomkill it rallick saidhis lips thinning into a straight line crokus nodded all right he turned and headed towards the strip of bright sunlight marking the next street he felt rallicks eyes on him until he stepped out on to traitors track he stopped off to his left climbed high gallows hill its immaculate flowered slope a burst of colours surrounding the fiftythree winding steps the five nooses above the platform swung slightly in the breeze their shadows streaks of black reaching down the slope to the cobbles of the street it had been a long time since the last high criminal was hanged while off in the gadrobi district the low gallows ropes were replaced weekly due to stretching an odd contrast to mark these tense timesabruptly he shook his head avoiding the turmoil of questions was too much of an effort had nom followed him no a lesser likelihood than the assassin having marked orr or someone in the estate for murdera bold contract he wondered who had had the guts to offer ita fellow noble no doubt but the courage of the contracts offering paled when compared to rallicks accepting itin any case the weight of the assassins warning was enough to crush any idea of thieving orrs estateat least for now crokus jammed his hands into his pockets as he walked his thoughts lost in a maze of dead ends he frowned with the realization that one of his hands probing deep in the pocket had closed around a coinhe withdrew it yes it was the coin hed found on the night of the assassinations he recalled its inexplicable appearance clattering at his feet an instant before the assassins crossbow quarrel whizzed pastbeneath the bright morning light crokus now took the time to examine it the first side he held up before him displayed the profile of a young man with an amused expression wearing some kind of floppy hat tiny runelike lettering ran around the edgea language the thief didnt recognize as it was so very different from the cursive daru script with which he was familiarcrokus turned the coin how odd another head this one a womans facing the other way the etched script here was of a style different from the opposite side a kind of leftslanting hatchwork the woman looked young with features similar to the mans her expression held nothing of amusement seeming to the thiefs eyes cold and unyieldingthe metal was old streaked here and there with raw copper and pitted around the faces with rough tin the coin felt surprisingly heavy though he concluded that its only worth lay in its uniqueness hed seen the coinage of callows genabackis amat el and once the ridged bars of the seguleh but none had looked like this onewhere had it fallen from had his clothing picked it up somewhere or had he kicked it into motion while crossing the roof or had it been among the darle maidens treasure crokus shrugged in any case its arrival had been timelyby this time his walk had taken him to the east gate just outside the city wall and along the road called jatems worry crouched the handful of sagging buildings named worrytown the thiefs destination the gate remained open during daylight hours and a slowplodding line of vegetablecarts crowded the narrow passage among them he saw as he pushed his way along one edge were the first wagonloads of refugees from pale those whod managed to slip through the siege lines during the battle and had crossed the south rhivi plain and then through the gadrobi hills and finally on to jatems worry scanning their faces he saw a fiery desperation dulled by exhaustion they looked upon the city with a jaded eye towards its meagre defences realizing that theyd bought only a short measure of time with their flight yet too tired to caredisturbed by what he saw crokus hurried through the gate and approached worrytowns largest structure a rambling wooden tavernover the door hung a board on which had been painted decades ago a threelegged ram to the thiefs mind the painting had nothing to do with the taverns name which was the boars tears the coin still in one hand crokus entered and paused just insidea few desultory faces turned to regard him briefly then swung back to their cups at a table in a gloomy corner opposite crokus saw a familiar figure its hands raised above its head and gesticulating wildly a grin tugged the thiefs lips and he strode forward and then did kruppe sweep with motion so swift as to be unseen by any the kings crown and sceptre from the sarcophagus lid too many priests in this tomb thinks kruppe then one less twould be a relief to all lest the dead kings musty breath shorten and so awaken his wraithmany times afore this had kruppe faced a wraiths wrath in some deep pit of drek droning its list of lifecrimes and bemoaning its need to devour my soulharrah kruppe was ever too elusive for such sundry spirits and their knockkneed chattercrokus laid a hand on kruppes damp shoulder and the shiny round face swung up to observe him ah kruppe exclaimed waving a hand towards his lone companion at the table and explaining an apprentice past comes to fawn in due fashion crokus be seated by all means possible wench some more of your finest wine haste crokus eyed the man seated opposite kruppe seems you two might be busy right nowhope flared in the mans expression and he rose quickly oh no he exclaimed by all means interrupt his eyes darted to kruppe then back to crokus i must be leaving in any event i assure you good day to you kruppe until some other time then the man bobbed his head then departedprecipitous creature kruppe muttered reaching for the mug of wine the man had left behind ah look at this he said frowning up at crokus nigh twothirds full a potential waste kruppe drank it down in one swift gulp then sighed said potential averted dessembrae be praisedcrokus sat was that man your trader contact he askedheavens no kruppe waved a hand a poor refugee from pale wandering lost fortunate for him was kruppe whose brilliant insights have sent himstraight out the door crokus finished laughingkruppe scowledthe serving woman arrived with an earthen carafe of soursmelling wine kruppe refilled the mugs and now wonders kruppe what would this expertly trained lad seek from this onetime master of all arts nefarious or have you triumphed yet again and come with booty atucked seeking proper dispensation and the likewell yesi mean no not quite crokus glanced around then leaned forward its about last time he whispered i knew youd be out here to sell the stuff i brought youkruppe leaned forward to meet the lad their faces inches apart the darle acquisition he whispered back waggling his eyebrowsexactly have you sold it off yetkruppe pulled a handkerchief from a sleeve and mopped his browwhat with all this talk of war the traders routes are all amiss so to answer your question uhm not quite yet admits kruppegreatkruppe started at the lads shout his eyes squeezing shut when they opened again they were thin slits ah kruppe understands the lad wishes their return to his possession so that he might seek higher recompense elsewherecrokus blinked no of course not i mean yes i want it back but im not planning on fencing it anywhere that is im still dealing with you on everything else only this ones special as he spoke crokus felt heat rise to his face and was thankful for the gloom a special case kruppea broad smile broke on kruppes round face why most certainly then lad shall i deliver said items to you this eve excellent consider the matter closed pray tell what do you have in yon hand therecrokus stared in confusion then he glanced down at his hand oh just a coin he explained showing it to kruppe i picked it up the same night i thieved darles twoheaded seeindeed may kruppe examine the peculiar item more closelycrokus obliged then reached for the mug of wine he leaned back i was thinking of orrs estate next he said casually his eyes fixed on kruppemmm kruppe turned the coin in his hand again and again poorest quality cast he muttered crooked stamping too orrs estate you say kruppe advises caution the house is well protected the metallurgist who foundried this should have been hanged indeed probably was thinks kruppe black copper no less cheap tin temperatures all too cool favour me crokus peruse the scene in the street from yon door if you spy a red and green merchants wagon wobbling into town kruppe would be much obliged for such informationcrokus rose and crossed the room to the door opening it he stepped outside and glanced around seeing no wagon in sight the youth shrugged again and went back inside he returned to the table no merchant wagonah well kruppe said he set down the coin on the table altogether worthless judges wise kruppe you may part with it at your leisurecrokus collected the coin and slipped it into his pocket no im keeping it for good luckkruppe looked up his eyes bright but crokus had his attention on the mug in his hands the fat man glanced away sighing kruppe must needs depart immediately if this eves rendezvous is to be propitious for all involvedcrokus drained his wine we can head back togetherexcellent kruppe rose pausing to brush crumbs from his chestshall we be off then he looked up to see crokus frowning down at his hand has something smitten the lad he asked quicklycrokus started he looked away guiltily the colour rising in his faceno he mumbled he glanced again at his hand i mustve picked up some wax somewhere he explained he rubbed his hand on his leg and grinned sheepishly lets goit will be a fine day for a walk pronounces kruppe who is wise in all thingswhite golds round encircled an abandoned tower with a panoply of brightly dyed awnings the goldsmith merchant shops each with their own security guards loitering outside faced out on the round street the aisles between them narrow cracks leading to the towers ruined compoundthe many tales of death and madness surrounding hinters tower and its environs kept it empty and uppermost in the minds of the goldsmiths an unlikely approach to their precious storesas the afternoon waned towards dusk the rounds crowds thinned and the private guards grew more wary iron grilles rattled into place over storefronts here and there and among the few that remained open torches were ignitedmurillio entered the round from the third tier road pausing every now and then to examine a shopkeepers wares wrapped in a shimmering blue cloak from the malle waste murillio knew his ostentatious display of wealth would do much to allay suspicionhe came to one shop in particular framed on either side by unlit storesthe goldsmith narrowfaced and pebblenosed leaned hawkishly on his counter his weathered hands before him bearing tiny grey scars that looked like raven tracks on mud one finger tapped a restless beat murillio approached meeting the mans beetle

teeth one but not the best come ill show you he went to the side door and opened itthrough here thenmurillio entered the shop black curtains covered the walls and the air was musty with old sweat krute led him into the back room which if anything was more rank and stifling than the first the goldsmith dropped the curtain between the two rooms and faced murilliomove quickly ive laid out a horde of fools gold and worthless stones on the counter out front if any sharpeyed customer marks them this hole will be finished he kicked at the back wall and a panel swung from its hinges crawl through dammit and tell rallick that the guild is not pleased with his generosity regarding our secrets gomurillio fell to his knees and pushed his way through the portal the earthen floor damp beneath his hands and staining his knees he groaned his distaste as the door swung down behind him then climbed to his feetbefore him rose hinters tower its mouldridden stone walls glistening in the dying light an overgrown cobbled pathway led up to the arched entrance bereft of a door and heavy with shadows of the chamber within murillio saw only darknessroots from the scraggy scrub oaks lining the path had pushed most of the cobbles up from the earth making the way treacherous after a cautious minute murillio arrived at the doorway he narrowed his gaze and tried to pierce the darkness rallick he hissed where the hell are you a voice spoke behind him youre latemurillio spun a long thin duelling rapier in his left hand rasping from its sheath and sweeping low into guard position a maingauche appearing in his right hand as he dropped into a defensive crouch then relaxeddammit rallickthe assassin grunted in amusement eyeing the rapiers razorsharp tip which had but a moment earlier hovered inches from his solar plexisgood to see your reflexes have not dulled friend all that wine and those pastries seem not to have girdled you muchmurillio resheathed his weapons i expected to find you in the towereyes widening rallick said are you mad the place is hauntedyou mean thats not just a story you assassins made up to keep people awayrallick turned and made his way to a lower terrace that had once overlooked the garden white stone benches squatted in the wiry yellow grass like the stained bones of some gargantuan beast below the terrace murillio saw as he joined the assassin sprawled a muddy algaefilled pond frogs croaked and mosquitoes buzzed in the tepid air some nights rallick said as he brushed dead leaves from one of the benches wraiths crowd the entranceyou can walk right up to them listen to their pleas and threats they all want out he sat downmurillio remained standing his gaze on the tower what of hinter himself does his wraith number among themno the madman sleeps within or so its said the wraiths are trapped in the sorcerers nightmareshe holds on to them and even hood cannot draw them to his cold bosom do you wish to know where those wraiths have come from murillio rallick grinned enter the tower and youll discover it first handmurillio had been about to go into the tower when rallick had surprised him thanks for the warning he snapped sarcastically gathering his cloak and sitting downrallick waved the mosquitoes from his face welli have them murillio said lady orrs most trusted handservant delivered them this afternoon he removed from inside his cloak a bamboo tube tied in blue ribbon two invitations to lady sinitals fte as promisedgood the assassin looked quickly at his friend youve not seen kruppes nose twitchnot yet ran into him this afternoon seems crokus is making some bizarre demands of course murillio added scowling who can tell when kruppes caught wind of something in any case ive seen nothing to suggest the slippery little gnome suspects were up to anythingwhat was that you said about crokus making bizarre demandsa peculiar thing that murillio mused when i dropped by the phoenix inn this afternoon kruppe was delivering to the lad the pickings from his last job now surely crokus hasnt abandoned kruppe as his fencewe all wouldve caught wind of thatthat was from an estate wasnt it whose rallick askeddarles murillio answered then his eyebrows rose kiss of gedderone the darle maiden the ripe one with the cheeksshes being shown at damn near every gathering all the frilly lads leaving a trail for the mopboys oh my our young thief is perchance smitten and now keeps her baubles for himself of all the hopeless dreams a boy could have hes reached for the worstmaybe rallick said quietly maybe not a word to his uncle murillios pained expression lifted a nudge in the right direction yes finally marnmot will be pleasedpatience rallick interjected turning a thieving child into a man of standing and learning will require more work than a swooning heart will managemurillio frowned well forgive me for being so excited at the prospect of saving the lads liferallicks smile was soft never regret such pleasure he saidcatching the assassins tone murillio sighed the sharp edges of his sarcasm sinking away its been many years since we had so many things of hope to strive for he said quietlythe path to one will be bloody rallick said dont forget that but yes its been a long time i wonder if kruppe even remembers such daysmurillio snorted kruppes memory is revised hourly all that holds him together is fear of being discoveredrallicks eyes darkened discoveredhis friend seemed far away but then he collected himself and smiledoh worn suspicions no more hes a slippery one is krupperallick chuckled at murillios mocking syntax he studied the pond before them yes he agreed after a time hes the slippery one all right he stood krute will be wanting to close up the rounds asleep by nowrightthe two men left the terrace methane mists swirling around their legsas they reached the path murillio turned for a look at the towers doorway wondering if he could see the gibbering wraiths but all he saw beneath the sagging arch was a wall of darkness in some strange way he found that more disturbing than any horde of lost souls he might imaginebright morning sunlight flowed in from the broad windows of baruks study and a warm wind slipped into the room carrying the smells and noises from the street below the alchemist still dressed in his nightclothes sat on a high stool at the map table he held a brush in one hand dipping it now and again into an ornate silver inkwellthe red ink had been watered down he painted wash on the map covering the areas now held by the malazan empire fully one half of the mapthe north halfwas red a small clear strip just south of blackdog forest marked caladan broods forces flanked on either side by two smaller patches indicating the crimson guard the red wash surrounded these clear spots and extended down to engulf pale ending on the north edge of the tahlyn mountainsthe street noises had become quite loud baruk noted as he leaned close to the map to paint the red tides southern border construction work he concluded hearing the squeal of winches and a voice bellowing at passersby the sounds died away then there came a loud crackbaruk jumped his right forearm jerking out and knocking over the inkwell the red ink poured across his mapcursing baruk sat back his eyes widened as he watched the spreading stain cover darujhistan and continue south to catlin he stepped down from the stool reaching for a cloth to wipe his hands more than a little shaken by what could easily be taken as an omen he walked across the chamber to the window bent forward and looked downa crew of workers was busy tearing up the street directly below two burly men swung picks while three others formed a line passing the shattered cobblestones to a growing pile on the pavement the foreman stood nearby his back to a wagon studying a parchment scrollbaruk frowned whos in charge of road maintenance he wondered alouda soft knock diverted his attention yeshis servant roald took a single step into the room one of your agents has arrived lordbaruk flicked a glance at the map table have him wait a moment roaldyes lord the servant stepped back and closed the doorthe alchemist walked over to the table and rolled up the ruined mapfrom the hallway came a ua voice ikkovieaby a murmur baruk slid the map on to a shelf and turned in time to see the agent enter on his trail a xxx waving at roald to leave baruk gazed down at the gaudily dressed man good day krupperoald stepped out and softly shut the doormore than good baruk dear friend of kruppe truly wonderful have you partaken of the morns fresh airbaruk glanced at the window unfortunately he said the air outside my window has become rather dustykruppe paused his arms returned to his sides then he reached into a sleeve and withdrew his handkerchief he patted his brow ah yes the road workers kruppe passed them on his way in a rather belligerent lot thinks kruppe indeed rude but hardly exceptional for such menial labourersbaruk gestured to a chairwith a beatific smile kruppe sat such a hot day he said eyeing the carafe of wine on the mantelpieceignoring this baruk strode to the window then turned his back to ithe studied the man wondering if he would ever catch a glimpse of what lay beyond kruppes cherubic demeanour what have you heard he asked softlywhat has kruppe heard what hasnt kruppe heardbaruk raised an eyebrow how about brevitythe man shifted in the chair and mopped his forehead such heatseeing baruks expression harden he continued now as for news he leaned forward his voice falling to a whisper tis muttered in corners in the bars in dark doorways of dank streets in the nefarious shadows of nocturnal night inget on with ityes of course well kruppe has caught wind of a rumour an assassins war no less the guild is taking losses tis saidbaruk turned back to the window his eyes on the street below and where do the thieves standthe rooftops are getting crowded throats are being slit profits have plummetedwheres rallickkruppe blinked hes disappeared he said kruppe has not seen him in daysthis assassins war it isnt internalnohas this new force been identified thennobaruks gaze intensified below the street workers seemed to spend more time arguing than working an assassins war could be troublevorcans guild was strong but the empire was stronger if indeed these newcomers were claws but something felt decidedly odd about the whole thing in the past the empress used such local guilds often recruited from them the alchemist could discern no purpose behind such a war and that was even more disturbing to him than the war itselfhearing a shuffling behind him he remembered his agent he turned and smiled you can go nowsomething flashed in kruppes eyes that startled baruk the fat man rose in a single fluid motion kruppe has more to tell master barukbemused the alchemist nodded for kruppe to continuethe tale is arduous and confused alas he said striding to join baruk at the window his handkerchief had disappeared kruppe can only surmise as best a man of innumerable talents may in moments of leisure during games of chance and the like in the aura of the twins an adept may hear see smell and touch things as insubstantial as the wind a taste of lady luck the bitter warning of the lords laughter kruppes gaze snapped to the alchemist do you follow masterhis eyes riveted on the mans round face baruk said quietly you speak of oponnkruppe looked back down at the street perhaps perhaps a grim feint meant to mislead such as foolish kruppefoolish baruk smiled inwardly not this manwho who can say kruppe raised a hand showing in his palm a flat disc of wax an item he said softly his eyes on the disc that passes without provenance pursued by many who thirst for its cold kiss on which life and all that lay within life is often gambled alone a beggars crown in great numbers a kings folly weighted with ruin yet blood washes from it beneath the lightest rain and to the next no hint of its cost it is as it is says kruppe worthless but for those who insist otherwisebaruk was holding his breath his lungs burned yet it was an effort to release them kruppes words had drawn him into somethinga place hinting of vast stores of knowledge and the sure unfailing eprecie hand that had gathered it marked it on parchment a library shelves of black wood in sharp relief tomes bound to shiny leather yellowed scrolls a pitted stained deskbaruk felt he had but stolen a single glance into this chamber kruppes mind the secret place with its door locked to all but one you speak baruk said slowly fighting to pull back into reality by focusing on the wax disc in kruppes hand of a coinkruppes hand snapped shut he turned and set the disc down on the windowsill examine this semblance master baruk it marks both sides of a single coin the handkerchief reappeared and kruppe stepped back dabbing his brow my but it is hot says kruppehelp yourself to some wine baruk murmured as the man left his side the alchemist opened his warren he gestured and the wax disc rose into the air slowly moving to hover before him at eyelevel he studied the imprint facing him the lady he muttered nodding the disc turned revealing to him the lord the disc turned again and baruks eyes widened as it began spinning a whirring sound filled the back of his head he felt his warren resisting a pressure that grew with the sound then his source collapsedfaintly as if from a great distance he heard kruppe speak even in this semblance master baruk blows the twins breath no mages warren can withstand that windthe disc still spun in the air in front of baruk a silver blur a fine mist expanded around it hot droplets spattered his face and he stepped backblue fire flickered from the melting wax the disc dwindling rapidly a moment later it vanished and the spinning sound and its accompanying pressure stopped abruptlythe sudden silence filled baruks head with pain he laid a trembling hand on the windowsill for support then closed his eyes who carries the coin kruppe his voice rasped from his constricted throat whokruppe once again stood at his side a lad he answered casually known to kruppe assuredly so as well as to your other agents murillio rallick and collbaruks eyes reopened that cant be a coincidence he hissed a desperate hope rising to struggle against the terror he felt oponn had entered the gambit and in such reaches of power the life of a city and those within it meant nothing he glared at kruppe gather the group then all youve named theyve served my interests for a long time and they must do so now above all other concerns do you understand mekruppe will convey your insistence rallick perchance is bound to guild duties while coll given purpose in life once again might well steady his gaze and tread and take this mission to heart master baruk what is the mission by the wayprotect the coinbearer watch him mark whose face rests on him benign or foul i must know if the lady has him or the lord and kruppe for this find rallick if the lord claims the coinbearer the assassins talents will be requiredkruppe blinked understood alas may mercy smile upon young crokuscrokus baruk frowned thats a name i knowkruppes face remained blanknever mind very well kruppe he turned back to the window once again keep me informedas always baruk kruppes friend the man bowed and thank you for the wine it was most deliciousbaruk heard the door open then close he gazed down the street hed managed to clamp a hold on his fear oponn had a way of making ruins of the most finely wrought plans baruk despised that prospect of chance operating in his affairs he could no longer rely on his ability to predict to prepare contingencies to work out every possibility and seek out the one best suited to his desires as the coin spun thus the cityadded to this the mysterious ways of the empress baruk rubbed his brow hed have to instruct roald to bring him some healing tea his headache was reaching debilitating proportions as he brought his hand down past his face his eyes caught a flash of red he raised both palms into view red ink stained them he leaned forward on the windowsillthrough a sparkling cloud of dust darujhistans rooftops sprawled and the harbour beyond and you empress he whispered i know youre here somewhere your pawns move unseen as yet but i will find thembe sure of that with or without oponns damned luckbook threethe missionmarionettes dance afield beneath masterly handsi stumble among them crossed by the strings in tangled twostep and curse all these fools in their mad pirouettei shall not live as they do oh no leave me in my circled dancethese unbidden twitchings you see i swear on hoods grave is artistry in motionsayings of the fool theny bule bchapter eighthe stepped down then among women and men the sigil stripped in her foul cleansing of emperor and first sword so tragic this treachery he was of the old guard commanding the honed edge of empires fury and so in stepping down but not away he remained the remembrance before her eyes the curse of conscience she would not standa price was placed before him that he glanced over in first passing unknowing and so unprepared in stepping down among women and men he found what hed surrendered and damned a quarterhour before dawn the sky held the colour of iron shot through with streaks of rust sergeant whiskeyjack squatted upon a dome of bedrock up from the pebble beach gazing out over the misty calm surface of lake azur far to the south on the lakes opposite shore rose the faint glow of darujhistanthe mountain crossing of the night just past had been hell the quorl tossed about in the midst of three warring thunderheads it was a miracle no one had been lost the rain had since stopped leaving the air cool and clammyhe heard the sound of boots accompanied by a clicking noise behind him whiskeyjack turned and straightened kalam and a black moranth approached picking their way through the mossy tumble of rocks at the base of the slope behind them rose the shadowed redwood forest the patched trunks standing like bearded sentinels against the mountainsidethe sergeant drew a deep breath of the chill morning aireverythings fine kalam said the green moranth delivered as ordered and more fiddler and hedge are two happy sapperswhiskeyjack raised an eyebrow he turned to the black moranth i thought your munitions were getting scarcethe creatures face remained in shadow beneath the hinged helmetthe words that came from it seemed born from a cavern hollow and faintly echoing selectively bird that steals you are well known to us bridgeburner you tread the enemys shadow from the moranth assistance will never be scarcesurprised whiskeyjack looked away the skin tightening around his eyesthe moranth continued you asked of the fate of one of our kind a warrior with but one arm who fought at your side in the streets of nathilog many years ago he lives stillthe sergeant took a deep breath of the sweet forest air thank you he saidwe wish that the blood you next find on your hands is your enemys bird that stealshe frowned then gave a brusque nod and turned his attention back to kalam what elsethe assassins face became expressionless quick bens ready he saidgood gather the others ill be laying out my planyour plan sergeantmine whiskeyjack said firmly the one devised by the empress and her tacticians is being rejected as of now were doing it my way get going corporalkalam saluted then leftwhiskeyjack stepped down from the rock his boots sinking into the moss tell me moranth might a squadron of your black be patrolling this area two weeks from nowthe moranths head swivelled audibly towards the lake such unscheduled patrols are common i expect to command one myself in two weeks timewhiskeyjack gazed steadily at the blackarmoured warrior standing beside him im not quite sure how to take that he said eventuallythe warrior faced him we are not so unalike he said in our eyes deeds have measure we judge we act upon our judgements as in pale we match spirit with spiritthe sergeant frowned what do you meaneighteen thousand seven hundred and thirtynine souls departed in the purge of pale one for each moranth confirmed as a victim of pales history of enmity towards us spirit with spirit bird that stealswhiskeyjack found he had no response the moranths next words shook him deeplythere are worms within your empires flesh but such degradation is natural in all bodies your peoples infection is not yet fatal it can be scoured clean the moranth are skilled at such effortshow exactly whiskeyjack paused choosing his words carefully do you intend this scouring he recalled the wagons piled with corpses winding out of pale and struggled against the ice tingling along his spinespirit with spirit the moranth answered returning his attention to the city on the south shore we depart for now you will find us here in two weeks time bird that stealswhiskeyjack watched the black moranth walk away pushing through the thicket surrounding the clearing where his riders waited a moment later he heard the rapid thud of wings then the quorl rose above the trees the moranth circled once overhead then turned north slipping between the bearded boles and heading upslopethe sergeant sat down on the bedrock again his eyes on the ground as the members of his squad arrived hunkering down around him he remained silent seeming unaware that he had company his brow furrowed and jaw bunching as he ground his molars with a slow steady precisionsarge fiddler said quietlystartled whiskeyjack looked up he drew a deep breath everyone had gathered with the exception of quick ben hed leave kalam to fill in the wizard later all right the original plans been scrapped since it was intended to get us all killed i didnt like that part so well do it my way and hopefully get out alivewe aint going to mine the city gates fiddler asked glancing at hedgeno the sergeant answered well put those moranth munitions to better use two objectives two teams kalam will lead one and with him will be quick ben and he hesitated  and sorry ill lead the other team the first task is to get into the city unnoticed out of uniform he looked to mallet i take it the green deliveredthe healer nodded its a local make all right eighteenfoot fisher four oars should get us across the lake easy enough even a couple of nets includedso well do some fishing whiskeyjack said coming into the harbour without a catch would look suspect anybody here ever fishedthere was silence then sorry spoke up i have a long time agowhiskeyjack stared at her then said right pick whoever you need for thatsorry smiled mockinglywhiskeyjack pulled his gaze from hers with an oath under his breathhe eyed his two saboteurs how much munitionstwo crates hedge replied adjusting his leather cap cussers all the way down to smokerswe could cook a palace fiddler added shifting about excitedlygood enough whiskeyjack said all right everyone listen and pay attention or we wont come out of this alivein a secluded glade in the forest quick ben poured white sand in a circle and sat down in its centre he took five sharpened sticks and set them in a row before him pushing them to various depths in the loam the centre stick the highest rose about three feet the ones on either side stood at two feet and the outer ones at a footthe wizard uncoiled a yards length of thin gut string he took one end and fashioned a scaleddown noose which he tightened over the centre stick near the top he ran the line to the left looping it once over the next shaft then crossed over to the right side and looped it again he brought the string across to the far left stick muttering a few words as he did sohe wrapped it twice and brought it over to the far right stick where he tied a knot and cut the trailing stringquick ben leaned back and folded his hands on his lap a frown creased his brow hairlock an outer stick twitched turned slightly then fell still hairlock he barked again all five shafts jerked the centre one bent towards the wizard the string tautened and a lowpitched hum emanated from ita cold wind swept across quick bens face stripping away the beads of sweat that had gathered in the last minute a rushing sound filled his head and he felt himself falling through dark caverns their unseen walls ringing in his ears as if iron hammers clanged against the rock flashes of blinding silver light stung his eyes and the wind pulled at the skin and flesh of his facein some shielded part of his mind he retained a sense of distance of control within this calm he could think observe analyse hairlock he whispered youve gone too far too deep this warren has swallowed you and will never spit you out youre losing control hairlock but these thoughts were for him alone he knew the puppet was still distanthe watched himself continue spinning whirling through the caverns of chaos hairlock was compelled to match him only upward abruptly he found himself standing beneath his feet the black rock seemed to swirl cracked here and there in its slow convolutions by bright glowing redlooking around he saw that he stood on a spar of rock rising at an angle its jagged apex a dozen feet in front of him turning his gaze followed the spar as it sank down and out of sight lost to billowing yellow clouds a moment of vertigo gripped quick ben he tottered then as he regained his balance he heard a chuckle behind him he turned to see hairlock perched atop the apex his wooden body smeared and scorched the dolls clothing ripped and frayedquick ben asked this is the spar of and isnt ithairlocks round head bobbed halfway now you know how far i have gone wizard to the very foot of the warren where power finds its first shape and all is possiblejust not very likely quick ben said eyeing the marionette how does it feel standing in the middle of all that creation but unable to touch it to use it its too alien isnt it it burns you with every reachill master it hairlock hissed you know nothing nothingquick ben smiled ive been here before hairlock he scanned the swirling gases around them scudding on contrary winds youve been lucky he said though they are few in number there are creatures who call this realm home he paused and turned his smile on the puppetthey dislike intrudershave you seen what they do to them what they leave behind the wizards smile broadened at seeing hairlocks involuntary jerk so you have he said quietlyyou are my protector hairlock snapped im bound to you wizard the responsibility is yours nor will i hide the fact if i am takenbound to me indeed quick ben lowered himself to his haunchesgood to hear your memorys come back tell me how fares tattersailthe puppet slumped looking away her recovery is a difficult onequick ben frowned recovery from whatthe hound gear tracked me hairlock shifted uneasily there was a skirmisha scowl grew on the wizards face andthe puppet shrugged gear fled sorely wounded by a mundane sword in the hands of that captain of yours tayschrenn then arrived but tattersail had slipped into unconsciousness by then so his search for answers was thwarted but the fire of suspicion has been stoked beneath him he sends out his servants and they stalk the warrens they hunt for signs of who and what i am and why tayschrenn knows your squad is involved he knows youre trying to save your own skins the puppets mad gaze flickered he wants you all dead wizard and as for tattersail perhaps he hopes her fever will kill her so he wont have tobut there is much hed lose if she died without his questioning her first no doubt hed seek out her soul hed pursue what she knows into hoods own realm but shed know enough to be elusiveshut up for a minute quick ben ordered back to the beginning you said captain paran stabbed gear with his swordhairlock scowled i did a mortal weaponit shouldnt have been possible he may well have dealt the hound a fatal wound the puppet paused then growled youve not told me everything wizard there are gods involved in this if you keep me in such ignorance i might well stumble into the path of one of them he spat a slave to you is bad enough do you think you could challenge a god for mastery of me id be taken turned perhaps even hairlock unsheathed one of his small knives used against you he advanced a step a dark glitter in his eyesquick ben raised an eyebrow inside his heart lurched in his chest was it possible would he not have detected something a flavour a hint of immortal presenceone last thing wizard hairlock murmured taking another step tattersails fever crested just this night past she screamed something about a coin a coin that had spun but now it has fallen it has bounced it has entered someones hand you must tell me about this coini must have your thoughts wizard the puppet stopped suddenly and looked down at the knife in his hand hairlock hesitated seeming confused then sheathed the weapon and squatted whats so important about a coin he growled nothing the bitch ravedshe was stronger than i had thoughtquick ben froze the puppet seemed to have forgotten that the wizard was present the thoughts he now heard were hairlocks own he realized he was looking through the shattered window into the puppets insane mind and it was there that all the danger lay the wizard held his breath as hairlock continued its eyes fixed on the clouds belowgear should have killed herwould have if not for that idiot captain what irony he now tends to her and puts his hand to his sword whenever i seek to come near he knows i would snuff her life in an instant but that sword what god plays with this fool noble the puppet spoke on but his words dwindled into inaudible mumblesquick ben waited hoping for more though what hed already heard was enough to set his heart pounding this mad creature was unpredictable and all that held him in check was a tenuous controlthe strings of power hed attached to hairlocks wooden body but with this kind of madness came strengthenough strength to break those stringsthe wizard was no longer as sure of his control as he had beenhairlock had fallen silent his painted eyes still flickered with black flamethe leaking of chaotic power quick ben took a step forwardpursue tayschrenns plans he commanded then he kicked hard the toe of his boot struck hairlocks chest and sent the puppet spinninghairlock flew out over the edge then fell downward his outraged snarl dwindled as he disappeared into the yellow cloudsquick ben drew a deep breath of the thick stale air he hoped that his abrupt dismissal had been enough to skew hairlocks recollections of the past few minutes still he felt those strings of control growing ever more taut the more this warren twisted hairlock the more power he would commandthe wizard knew what hed have to dohairlock had given it to him in fact still quick ben wasnt looking forward to it the taste of sour bile rose into his mouth and he spat over the ledge the air stank of sweat and it was a moment before he realized it was his own he hissed a curse time to leave he muttered he raised his armsthe wind returned with a roar and he felt his body flung up up into the cavern above then the next as the caverns blurred by a single word clung to his thoughts a word that seemed to twist around the problem of hairlock like a webquick ben smiled but it was a smile responding to terror and the word remained gear and with that name the wizards terror found a facewhiskeyjack rose amid silence the expressions arrayed around him were sober eyes downcast or fixed elsewhere closed into some personal private place where swam the heaviest thoughts the lone exception was sorry who stared at the sergeant with bright approving eyeswhiskeyjack wondered who was doing the approving within those eyesthen he shook his head angry that something of quick ben and kalams suspicions had slipped into his thoughtshe glanced away to see quick ben approaching the wizard looked tired an ashen tint to his face whiskeyjacks gaze snapped to kalamthe assassin nodded everyone look alive he said load up the boat and get it readymallet leading the way the others headed down to the beachwaiting for quick ben to arrive kalam said the squad looks beat sergeant fiddler trotts and hedge moved enough dirt in those tunnels to bury the empires dead im worried about them mallethe seems to be holding together so far still whatever sorry knows about fishing i doubt any one of us could row their way out of a bathtub and were about to try crossing a lake damn near big as a seawhiskeyjacks jaw tightened then he forced a casual shrug into his shoulders you know damn well that any warren opening anywhere near the city will likely be detected no choice corporal we row unless we can rig up a sailkalam grunted since when does the girl know about fishingthe sergeant sighed i know came out of nowhere didnt itbloody convenientquick ben reached the dome of rock both men fell silent at seeing his expressionim about to propose something youre going to hate the wizard saidlets hear it whiskeyjack replied in a voice empty of feelingten minutes later the three men arrived on the slick pebbled beach both whiskeyjack and kalam looking shaken a dozen yards from the waters edge sat the fisher boat trotts was straining on the rope attached to the prow hook gasping and moaning as he leaned forward with all his weightthe rest of the squad stood in a clump off to one side quietly discussing trotts futile efforts fiddler chanced to look up seeing whiskeyjack marching towards them he blanchedtrotts the sergeant bellowedthe barghasts face woad tattoos stretched into illegibility turned to whiskeyjack with wide eyeslet go of the rope soldierkalam released an amused snort behind whiskeyjack who glared at the others now he said his voice harsh since one of you idiots convinced everyone else that loading all the equipment into the boat when its still on shore was a good idea you can all man the rope and drag it into the lakenot you trotts you get inside get comfortable there at the stern whiskeyjack paused he studied sorrys expressionless facefrom fiddler and hedge i expect this but i thought i put you in charge of setting things upsorry shruggedwhiskeyjack sighed can you rig us a sailtheres no windwell maybe there will be whiskeyjack said exasperatedyes sorry answered we have some canvas well need a masttake fiddler and make one now the rest of you get this boat into the watertrotts climbed inside and sat down at the stern he stretched out his long legs and draped an arm over the splashboard he bared his filed teeth in what might have been a smilewhiskeyjack turned to a grinning kalam and quick ben well he demanded whatre you waiting forthe grins diedchapter ninehave you seen the one who stands apart cursed in a ritual sealing his kind beyond death the host amassed and whirling like a plague of pollenhe stands apart the first among all ever veiled in time yet outcast and alone a tlan imass wandering like a seed unfallenlay of onos toolan toc the youngertoc the younger leaned forward in his saddle and spat it was his third day out from pale and he longed for the citys high wall around him the rhivi plain stretched out on all sides cloaked in yellow grass that rippled in the afternoon wind but otherwise featureless he scratched the edges of the wound that had taken his left eye and muttered under his breath something was wrong he should have met her two days past nothing was going as planned these days what with captain paran vanishing before even meeting whiskeyjack and the story making the rounds about a hound attacking the nds lastsurviving mage and leaving fourteen dead marines in its wake he supposed he shouldnt be surprised that this rendezvous had gone awry as wellchaos seemed a sign of the times toc straightened and rose in his saddle though there was no true road as such on the plain merchant caravans had mapped a rough track running northsouth along the western edge trade had since died out but the passing of generations of wagons and horse trains had left its mark the centre of the plain was home to the rhivi those small brownskinned people who moved with the herds in a seasonal cycle though not warlike the malazan empire had forced their hand and now they fought and scouted alongside caladan broods tiste and legions against the empiremoranth reports placed the rhivi far to the north and east and toc was thankful for that he was feeling very alone out in this wasteland yet loneliness was a lesser evil all things consideredtocs single eye widened it seemed he wasnt so alone after allperhaps a league ahead ravens wheeled the man cursed and loosened the scimitar sheathed at his hip he fought the urge to push his horse into a gallop and settled for a quick trotas he neared he saw trampled grass off to one side of the traders track the cackling laughter of the ravens was the only sound to break the stillness they had already begun feeding toc reined in his horse and sat unmoving in his saddle hunched forward none of the bodies he saw looked as if they were apt to start moving and the ravens preoccupied squabbling was good evidence that any survivors had long gone still he a bad feeling about this something hung in the air something between a smell and a tastehe waited for what he wasnt certain but a reluctance to move gripped him all at once he identified the strangeness he felt magic it had been unleashed here i hate this he muttered then dismountedthe ravens gave him room but not much ignoring their outraged shrieks he approached the bodies they numbered twelve in all eight wore the uniforms of malazan marinesbut these werent average soldiers his gaze narrowed on the silver sigils on their helmetsjakatakan he said tlites theyd been cut to pieceshe turned his attention to the remaining bodies and felt a tremor of fear run through him no wonder the jakatakan had taken such a beating toc strode to one of the bodies and crouched beside it he knew something of the clan markings among the barghast how each hunter group was identified through their woad tattooing the breath hissed between his teeth and he reached out to turn the savages face towards him then he nodded these were ilgres clan before the crimson guard had enlisted them their home territory had been fifteen hundred leagues to the east among the mountains just south of the porule slowly toc rose the ilgres numbered among the strongest of those who had joined the crimson guard at blackdog forest but that was four hundred leagues north so what had brought them herethe stench of spilled magic wafted across his face and he turned his eye fixing on a body he hadnt noticed before it lay beside scorched grass so he said my questions answered this band had been led by a barghast shaman somehow theyd stumbled on to a trail and this shaman had recognized it for what it was toc studied the shamans body killed by a sword wound in the throat the unleashing of sorcery had been the shamans but no magic had opposed him and that was odd particularly since it was the shaman who had died rather than whomever hed attackedtoc grunted well shes said to be hell on mages he walked a slow circle around the kill site and found the trail with little difficulty some of the jakatakan had survived and from the smaller set of bootprints so had their charge and overlaying these tracks were half a dozen moccasin prints the trail veered westerly from the traders track yet still led southreturning to his horse toc mounted and swung the animal aroundhe removed the short bow from its saddle holster and strung it then nocked an arrow there was no hope of coming up on the barghast undetected out on this plain hed be visible a long time before entering arrowrangeand that range had become much closer now that hed lost an eye so theyd be waiting for him with those damn lances but he knew he had no choice he hoped only to take down one or two of them before they skewered himtoc spat again then wrapped the reins around his left forearm and adjusted his grip on the bow he gave the wide red scar crossing his face a vigorous painful scratch realizing that the maddening itch would return in moments anyway oh well he said then drove his heels into the horses flanksthe lone hill that rose up before adjunct lorn was not a natural one the tops of mostly buried stones encircled its base she wondered what might be entombed within it then dismissed her misgivings if those standing stones were of the size shed seen rising around the mysterious barrows outside genabaris this mound dated back millennia she turned to the two exhausted marines stumbling in her wake well make our stand here you with the crossbow i want you lying up topthe man ducked his head in answer and staggered to the mounds grassy summit both he and his comrade seemed almost relievedtha shed called a halt though they knew their death was but minutes awaylorn eyed the other soldier hed taken a lance barb in his left shoulder and the blood still flowed profusely down the front of his breastplate how he had stayed on his feet in the last hour was beyond lorns understanding he looked upon her with eyes dulled by resignation showing nothing of the pain he must be feelingill hold your left he said shifting his grip on the curved tulwar in his right handlorn unsheathed her own longsword and fixed her attention northwards only four of the six barghast were visible approaching slowlywere being flanked she called out to her crossbowman take the one on your leftthe soldier beside her grunted my life need not be sheltered he saidwe were charged with your protection adjunctquiet lorn commanded the longer you stand the better protected ill be she saidthe soldier grunted againthe four barghast were lingering now just out of bowshot range two still carried their lances the other two gripped short axes then a voice cried out far to lorns right and she whirled to see a lance speeding towards her and behind it a charging barghastlorn brought her blade across her body and dropped into a crouch as she raised the weapon over her head her sword caught the lances shaft and even as it did so she was turning pulling her weapon to one sidethe deflected lance sped past and cracked into the hillside off to her rightbehind her she heard the crossbowman release a quarrel as she spun back to the four charging barghast there came a scream of pain from the other side of the mound the soldier beside her seemed to have forgotten his wound as he gripped his tulwar with both hands and planted his feet wideattend adjunct he saidthe barghast off to the right cried out and she turned to see him spinning with the impact of a quarrelthe four warriors before them were no more than thirty feet awaythe two with lances now launched them lorn made no move realizing almost immediately that the one aimed at her would fly wide the soldier beside her dropped away to his left but not enough to avoid the lance as it thudded into his right thigh it struck with such force as to drive right through his leg and embed itself in the earth the soldier was pinned but his only response was a soft gasp and he raised his sword to parry an axe swinging at his headin this time lorn had already closed with the barghast rushing at herhis axe was a shorter weapon and she took advantage of this with a thrust before he came into his own range he brought the coppersheathed haft up to parry but lorn had already flicked her wrist completing the feint and dipping under the axe her lunge buried the sword point in the barghasts chest slicing the leather armour as if were clothher attack had committed her and her sword was nearly wrenched from her hand as the savage toppled backwards offbalance she staggered a step expecting the crushing blow of an axe but it didnt arrive regaining her balance she spun round to find her crossbowman now wielding his tulwar engaging the other barghast lorn snapped her attention to see how her other guard faredsomehow he still lived though he faced two barghast hed managed to drag the lance out of the earth but the weapons shaft remained in his leg that he was able to move at all much less defend himself spoke eloquently of jakatakan discipline and traininglorn rushed to engage the barghast on the mans right nearest her even as she did so an axe slipped past the soldiers guard and struck him across the chest scale snapped as the heavy weapons edge ripped through armour the soldier groaned and fell to one knee blood sprurting on to the groundlorn was in no position to defend him and could only watch in horror as the axe swung again this time striking the man in the head his helmet collapsed inward and his neck broke he toppled sideways laying at lorns feet her forward momentum carried her right over hima curse broke from her lips as she sprawled crashing into the bargh in front of her she tried to bring the point of her sword up behind but he twisted lithely to one side and leaped away lorn took a swing at him missing even as she fell she felt her shoulder dislocate as she hit the hard ground and the sword dropped from her numbed hand now she thought the only thing left to do is die she rolled on to backwith a growl the barghast was standing beside her axe raised high lorn was in a good position to see the skeletal hand bursting from earth beneath the barghast it grasped an ankle bones snapped the warrior screamed vaguely as she watched she wondered where the other two savages had gone all sounds of fighting seemed to be stopped but the ground rumbled with a growing urgent thunderthe barghast stared down at the hand crushing his shin he screamed again as the wide rippled blade of a flint sword shot up between his legs the axe left the warriors hands as he frantically brought them down in an effort to deflect the sword twisting to one side and kicking out his free leg it all came too late the sword impaled him jamming against his hipbone and lifting him from the ground his dying shriek rose wardlorn climbed to her feet with difficulty her right arm hanging useless at her side she identified the thundering sound as the beat of hoofs and turned in the direction from which they came a malazan as that fact sank in she swung her attention from the rider and looked around both her guards were dead and arrows jutted from two barghast bodiesshe took a shallow breathall she could manage as pain spread across her chestand gazed upon the creature that had risen from the earth it was cloaked in rotting furs and it stood over the warriors body one leg still clutched in its hand the other hand gripped the sword which had been pushed the length of the barghasts body the point emerging from his necki was expecting you days ago lorn said glaring at the figureit turned to regard her its face hidden in shadow beneath the yellowed bone shelf of its helmet the helmet she saw was the skullcap of some horned beast one horn broken off at its basethe rider arrived behind her adjunct he called out dismounting he came to her side bow still in his hand and arrow nocked his lone eye glanced across lorn and seeming satisfied that her wound was not mortal fixed on the massive but squat creature facing them hoods breath a tlan imasslorn continued glaring at the tlan imass i knew you were about its the only thing that explains a barghast shaman bringing himself and his handpicked hunters into the area he must have used a warren to get here so where were youtoc the younger stared at the adjunct amazed at her outburst his gaze flicked back to the tlan imass the last time hed seen one was in seven cities eight years past and then it had been from a distance as the undead legions marched out into the western wastelands on some mission even the empress could learn nothing about at this close range toc eagerly studied the tlan imass not much left of it he concludeddespite the sorcery three hundred thousand years had taken their tollthe skin that stretched across the squat mans robust bones was a shiny nut brown in colour the texture of leather whatever flesh it had once covered had contracted to thin strips the consistency of oak rootssuch muscles showed through torn patches here and there the creatures face what toc could see of it bore a heavy chinless jawbone high cheeks and a pronounced brow ridge the eye sockets were dark holesi asked you a question lorn grated where were youthe head creaked as the imass looked down at its feet exploring it said quietly in a voice born of stones and dustlorn demanded your name tlanonos toolan once of the tarad clan of the logros tlan i was birthed in the autumn of the bleak year the ninth son to the cla whetted as warrior in the sixth jaghut warenough lorn said she sagged wearily and toc moved to her side glancing up at him she scowled you look grim then a small smile came to her lips but good to metoc grinned first things first adjunct a place for you to rest she did not protest as he guided her to a grassy knoll near the barrow and gently pushed her to her knees he glanced back to see the tlan imas still standing where it had first emerged from the ground it had turned however and seemed to be studying the barrow we must make you arm immobile toc said to the worn weathered woman kneeling befor him i am named toc the younger he said squatting downshe raised her gaze at this i knew your father she said her smile returned also a great bowmanhe ducked his head in replyhe was a fine commander too lorn continued studying the ravaged youth who was now tending to her arm the empress has regretted his deathnot dead for sure toc interrupted his tone tight and his single eye averted as he began removing the gauntlet from her hand disappearedyes lorn said softly disappeared since the emperors death she winced as he pulled away the gauntlet and tossed it asideill need some strips of cloth he said risinglorn watched him stride to one of the barghast bodies she had not known who her claw contact would be only that he was the last left alive among dujeks forces she wondered why he had veered so sharply from his fathers path there was nothing pleasant or proud in being claw only efficiency and fearhe took a knife to the bodys tanned leather armour slicing it back to reveal a rough woollen shirt into which he cut then he returned to her side a handful of long strips in one hand i didnt know you had a imass for company he said as he crouched beside her againthey choose their own modes of travel lorn said a hint of anger in her voice and come when they please but yes hes an integral player in my mission she fell silent gritting her teeth in pain as toc slipped th rude sling over her shoulder and under her armi have little good to report toc said and he told her of parans disappearance and of whiskeyjack and his squad departing without the yj i captain in attendance by the time he had finished he had adjusted the sling to his own satisfaction and sat back on his haunches with sighdamn lorn hissed help me to my feetafter hed done so she wobbled a bit and gripped his shoulder to steady herself then she nodded get me my swordtoc strode to the spot shed indicated after a brief search he found the longsword in the grass and his eye thinned to a slit upon seeing the weapons dusty red blade he brought it to her and said an otataral sword adjunct the ore that kills magicand mages lorn said taking the weapon awkwardly in her left hand and sheathing iti came upon the dead shaman toc saidwell lorn said otataral is no mystery to you of the seven cities but few here know it and i would keep it that wayunderstood toc turned to regard the immobile imasslorn seemed to read his thought otataral cannot quench their magicbelieve me its been tried the warrens of the imass are similar to those of the jaghut and the forkrul assailelder blood and earthboundthat flint sword of his will never break and it cuts through the finest iron as easily as it will flesh and bonetoc shivered and spat ill not envy you your company adjunctlorn smiled youll be sharing it for the next few days toc the younger weve a long walk to palesix seven days toc said i expected you to be mountedlorns sigh was heartfelt the barghast shaman worked his talents on them a disease took them all even my stallion which i brought with me through the warren her lined face softened momentarily and toc could feel her genuine sorrowit surprised him all that hed heard of the adjunct had painted for him a picture of a coldblooded monster the gauntleted hand of death that could descend from anywhere at any time perhaps this side of her existed he hoped he would not have to see it then again he corrected himself shed not spared her soldiers a second glance toc spoke youll ride my mare adjunct shes no warhorse but shes quick and long on endurancethey walked to where hed left his horse and lorn smiled thats a wickan breed toc the younger she said as she laid a hand on the mares neck so cease the modesty else i lose trust in you a fine animaltoc helped her into the saddle do we leave the imass where it is he askedlorn nodded hell find his own way now lets give this mare the opportunity to prove herself wickan blood is said to smell of iron she reached down and offered her left arm mount up she saidtoc barely managed to hide his shock share the saddle with the adjunct of the empire the notion was so absurd that he came near to laughing i can walk adjunct he said gruffly with such little time to waste you would be better to ride on and ride hard youll see pales walls in three days i can manage a jog at tenhour stretchesno toc the younger lorns tone brooked no argument i need you in pale and i need to hear all there is about the occupying legions and dujek and tayschrenn better to arrive a few days late than unprepared now grasp my arm and lets be on with ittoc compliedas he sank into the saddle behind lorn his mare snorted and stepped quickly to one side both he and the adjunct almost fell they turned to see the tlan imass standing beside them it raised its head to lornthe barrow has yielded a truth adjunct onos toolan saidtoc felt her stiffen and that iswe are upon the right path the tlan imass repliedsomething told toc that the path the creature referred to had nothing to do with the traders track leading south to pale he cast one final glance back at the barrow as lorn silently swung the horse around and then at onos toolan neither seemed likely to unveil their secrets but lorns reaction had raised the hairs on the back of his neck and the itch around his lost eye roused itself toc muttered a curse under his breath and began to scratchsomething the matter toc the younger lorn asked not turninghe thought about his reply he said the price of being blind adjunct nothing morecaptain paran paced in the narrow room this was madness all he knew was that he was being hidden but the only answers to his questions would come from a bedridden sorceress locked in some strange fever and a nasty puppet whose painted eyes seemed to fix on him with intense hatredvague memories haunted him as well the feel of slick cold stones scraping beneath his fingernails at a moment when all his strength had poured from his body and then the hazy vision of a massive doga hound in the room a dog that seemed to breathe death it had been seeking to kill the woman and hed stopped itsomehow he wasnt sure of the detailsa suspicion nagged him that the dog wasnt dead that it would be back the puppet ignored most of his questions and when it did speak to him it was to voice dire threats apparently though the sorceress was ill her presence aloneher continued existencewas all that kept hairlock from fulfilling those threatswhere was whiskeyjack had the sergeant left without him what would that do to adjunct lorns planhe ceased pacing and turned a glare on the sorceress lying in the bedhairlock had told paran that shed somehow hidden him when tayschrenn arrived the high mage having sensed the dogs presenceparan had no memory of any of that but he wondered how the woman could have managed anything after the beating shed taken hairlock had scoffed that the sorceress hadnt even been aware of opening her warren that one last time that shed done it all on instinct paran had the feeling that the marionette had been scared by that unveiling of power hairlock seemed most eager for the womans death but was either unable to achieve it himself or too frightened to try the creature had muttered something about wards shed raised about her personyet paran found nothing to impede his ministrations when the fever had been at its worst it had broken the previous night and now paran felt his impatience reaching some kind of threshold the sorceress slept but if she didnt awaken soon hed take matters into his own handsleave this hiding place perhaps seek out toc the younger provided he could avoid tayschrenn or any officers on his way out of the buildingparans unseeing glare remained fixed on the sorceress his thoughts racing slowly a new awareness tickled the edges of his mind and he abruptly blinked the womans eyes were open and they studied himhe took a halfstep forward but was stopped dead by her first wordsi heard the coin drop captainthe blood drained from parans face an echo flittered through his memory a coin he asked his voice barely a whisper a spinning cointhe voices of gods of dead men and women howls of houndsall pieces of my memorys torn tapestryspins no longer the woman replied she pushed herself into a sitting position how much do you rememberscant the captain admitted surprised at himself for telling the truth the puppet will not even tell me your name he saidtattersail ive been uh in the company of whiskeyjack and his squad a veil of caution seemed to slip over her sleepy gaze i was to take care of you until your health returnedi believe you did paran said and i returned the favour which evens the scales sorceressso it does well now whatparans eyes widened you dont knowtattersail shruggedbut this is ridiculous paran exclaimed i know nothing of whats happening here i awaken to find a halfdead witch and a talking puppet for company and of my new command not a single sign have they left for darujhistan alreadyi cant give you much in the way of answers tattersail murmured all i can tell you is the sergeant wanted you alive because he needs to know who tried to assassinate you wed all like to know in fact she fell silent expectantparan studied her round ghostly pale face there was something about her that seemed to disregard her physical mundanity overwhelmed it in fact so that the captain found himself responding in ways that surprised him it was he saw a friendly face and he couldnt recall the last time hed experienced such a thing it left him offbalance with only tattersail to steady him and that made him feel as if he were descending a spiral with the sorceress in the centre descending perhaps it was an ascent he wasnt sure and the uncertainty made him waryi recall nothing of it he said and that wasnt entirely a lie though it felt like it with her heavylidded eyes steady upon himi think paran added despite his misgivings there were two of them i recall a conversation though i was dead i thinkbut you heard a spinning coin tattersail saidyes he answered bewildered and more i went to a place yellow infernal light a chorus of moans a deaths headtattersail nodded to herself as if confirming a suspicion a god intervened captain paran returned the life to you you might think it was on your behalf but im afraid there wasnt any altruism involved are you following meim being used paran stated flatlyshe raised an eyebrow that doesnt bother youparan shrugged and turned away its nothing new he mutteredi see she said quietly so whiskeyjack was right then youre not just some new captain youre something a lot morethats my concern paran snapped still avoiding her gaze then he faced her his expression dark and whats your role in all this you took care of me why serving your god are youtattersail barked a laugh not likely nor did i do much for you in any case oponn took care of thatparan stiffened oponn the twins sister and brother the twins of chance he who pushes she who pulls have they been in my dreams voices mention of my sword he was still for a moment then he strode over to the dresser on it lay his sheathed sword he laid a hand on the grip i purchased this sword three years ago though its first use came just a few nights pastagainst the dogyou recall thatsomething in tattersails voice brought him around in her eyes he now saw fear she made no attempt to hide it he nodded yet i named the weapon the day i bought itthe nameparans grin was ghastly chancethe pattern has been long in the weaving tattersail said closing her eyes and sighing though i suspect even oponn could not have imagined your blade tasting its first blood on a hound of shadowparan closed his eyes then he sighed the dog was a houndshe looked at him and nodded youve met hairlocki havebeware him tattersail said it was his unleashing of a warren of chaos that left me fevered if warrens are indeed structured then hairlocks is diametrically opposed to mine hes mad captain and he vowed to kill youparan strapped on his sword whats his role in all of thisim not sure tattersail saidthat sounded like a lie but paran let it pass he was coming in nightly to check on your progress he said but i havent seen him the past two nightshow many days have i been outsix i think im no more certain of times passage than you are im afraid he strode to the door all i know is i cant just hide here for everwaitparan smiled very well he faced her again tell me why shouldnt i leavethe sorceress hesitated then spoke i still need you here she saidwhyits not me that hairlocks afraid of she answered seeming to find the words difficult its youyour swordthats kept me alive he saw what you managed to do to the hounddamn he hissed though essentially still a stranger to him shed reached through to him with her admission he tried to fight the compassion welling up inside him he told himself that his mission overrode all other concerns that hed repaid his debt to her if ever there was one that she hadnt given him all the reasons he suspected existed for his staying hidden meaning she didnt trust himhe told himself all these things but none of it was enoughif you go she said hairlock will kill mewhat of the wards about you he demanded almost desperately hairlock said youve wards about youtattersails smile was drawn you think hed just come right out and tell you how dangerous you really are wards she laughed ive barely the strength to sit straight if i attempted to open my warren in this state the power would consume me burn me to ashes hairlock wants you kept in the darkabout everything the puppet liedeven this rang like a halftruth in parans ears but there was enough there that made sense that gave reason to hairlocks hatred of him and the puppets obvious fear the greater deceit would come from hairlock not tattersail or so he believed though there was little to support that beliefonly at least tattersail was human he sighed sooner or later he said unclipping his sword belt and returning it to the dresser you and i will have to cut past all this misleading gameplaying oponn or no weve a common enemytattersail sighed thank you captain paranhe eyed her warily whatshe smiled it is good to meet youhe scowled she was at it againthis seems an unhappy army lorn said as they waited outside pales north gate one of the guards had entered the city in search of another horse while the remaining three stood muttering a short distance awaytoc the younger had dismounted he moved close to his horse and said it is adjunct very unhappy along with the dismantling of the second and sixth armies came a shuffling of commands nobodys where they were before right down to the greenest recruit squads split up everywhere and now theres the rumour that the bridgeburners are going to be retired he glanced over at the three marines saw their hard eyes on him and the adjunct people around here dont like that he said quietlylorn leaned back in her saddle the pain in her shoulder had become a steady throb and she was glad the journey was doneat least for the time being theyd seen nothing of the tlan imass since the barrow though she often sensed his presence in the dusty wind beneath the plains cracked pan while in the company of toc the younger shed sensed the restless anger churning among the malazan forces on this continentin pale ten thousand soldiers crowded the edge of revolt the spies among them brutally removed awaiting only high fist dujeks wordand the high mage tayschrenn wasnt easing the situation by openly countermanding dujeks instructions to his officers yet what troubled the adjunct the most was this vague tale of a hound of shadow doing battle with the nds last cadre magethere was a mystery there and she suspected it was vital the rest could be dealt with provided she took chargethe adjunct was eager for her meeting with tayschrenn and this sorceress tattersailthe name was familiar tugging at memories that seemed born in her childhood and around such evasive hints rustled a cloak of fear but she was determined to deal with that when the time camethe gate swung open she looked up to see the marine with a warhorse and they had company toc the younger snapped a salute the energy behind it making lorn wonder at his loyalty the adjunct dismounted slowly then nodded at high fist dujekthe man seemed to have aged a dozen years since shed last seen him thirteen months ago in genabaris a small smile came to lorns mouth as the scene emerged in her mind the high fist a worn weary onearmed man the empresss adjunct her sword arm in a sling and toc the younger last representative of the claw on genabackis oneeyed and half his face scarred by fire here they were representatives of three of the four empire powers on the continent and they all looked like hellmisreading her smile dujek grinned good to see you too adjunct i was overseeing the resupply when this guard brought word of your arrival his gaze grew thoughtful as he studied her the grin fading ill find you a denul healer adiunctsorcery doesnt work on me high fist it hasnt in a long time a mundane healer is sufficient her gaze narrowed on dujek assuming ill have no need to unsheath my sword within the walls of palei make no guarantees adjunct dujek said casually come let us walklorn turned to toc the younger thank you for the escort soldierdujek laughed his eyes bright on toc unnecessary adjunct i know who and what toc the younger isas does virtually everyone else if hes as good a claw as he is a soldier youd do well to keep him dujek gestured that they walk meaning that his reputation as a soldier of the second is the only thing preventing a knife across the throat meaning get him out of palethe adjunct eyed toc i will see you later she said joining dujek who had passed beneath the gates massive arch lorn matched his pace as they entered the city soldiers crowded the streets directing merchant wagons and the mobs of citizenry evidence of the rain of death still scarred many of the buildings but labourers had beenthe nobility are about to be culled dujek said at her sideempire policy lorn replied stiffly youre well aware of that high fistdujek glared at her nine out of ten nobles to hang adjunct children includedlorn stared at him that seems excessivedujek was silent for a time leading her down the main avenue then heading uphill towards the empire headquarters many faces turned to regard them stonily as they passed it seemed dujeks identity was known among pales citizens lorn tried to sense the atmosphere his presence created but couldnt be certain if it was fear or respect or bothmy mission lorn said as they approached a threestorey stone building its entrance blocked by a dozen watchful marines will take me out of the city sooni dont want any details adjunct dujek cut in you do what you have to do and just stay out of my wayhis tone was unthreatening almost pleasant but lorn felt her muscles tense this man was being pushed and tayschrenn was doing the pushing what was the high mage up to the whole situation stank of incompetenceas i was saying lorn continued i wont be here long when i am here however and her voice hardened i will make plain to the high mage that his interference in the citys management will not be tolerated if you need backing you have it dujekthey stopped just outside the buildings entrance and the old man gazed steadily at her as if weighing her sincerity but when he spoke his words surprised her i can take care of my own problems adjunct do what you will but im not asking for anythingyoull permit the excessive culling of the nobility thendujeks expression set into stubborn lines battle tactics can be applied in any situation adjunct and the high mage is no tactician he turned and led her up the steps two guards opened the doors which looked new and were banded in bronze the high fist and the adjunct enteredthey strode down a long wide hallway marked by doors on either side every dozen feet or so marines stood guard before each one hands on their weapons it was clear to lorn that the incident with the hound had heightened wariness to an almost absurd degree then a thought struck her high fist have there been attempts on your lifedujeks grunt was amused four in the last week adjunct you get used to it all these marines here volunteered themselvesthey dont even listen to me any more the last assassin was so badly chopped up i couldnt even make out if it was a man or a wornanyou have a lot of seven cities natives in your legions high fistaye loyal to a fault when they want to beloyal to what lorn wondered and to whom seven cities recruits were being sent elsewhere these days the empress did not wish dujeks soldiers to become aware that their homeland was on the brink of open rebellion such news might well tip the scales here on genabackis and that in turn would trigger seven cities itself both lorn and the empress were well aware how dangerous things had become and they had to tread carefully indeed in their efforts to repair the damage and it was now becoming obvious that tayschrenn presented a major problemshe realized that she needed dujeks support more than he needed hersthey arrived at the halls end where stood massive double doors the soldiers at either side saluted the high fist then opened them beyond was a large chamber dominated by a hardwood table in its centre maps scrolls ink and paint jars crowded its surface dujek and lorn entered and the doors were shut behind themtayschrenn has been informed of your arrival but will be delayed somewhat dujek said sitting on the edge of the table if you have questions regarding the recent events at pale ask them nowshe knew he was giving her the opportunity to hear answers that didnt come from tayschrenn though as to whose version of the truth she would accept was up to her lorn began to appreciate dujeks comment about battle tactics she strode to a nearby chair and settled slowly into its cushions very well high fist small matters first have you encountered any difficulty with the moranthdujek scowled funny you should ask theyre getting pretty highminded about some things i had a hell of a time getting the gold legionstheir eite warriorsto fight caladan brood seems they consider him too honourable to treat as an enemy the whole alliance was on shaky ground for a while there but in the end they marched soon ill send the black to join thernlorn nodded similar problems with the green and the blue in genabaris she said which explains why i came overland the empress suggests we make the most of the alliance since it may not lastwe havent much choice dujek growled how many legions will i have in the spring landinglorn hesitated then said two and a regiment of wickan lancers the wickans and the eleventh legion will disembark at nathilog the ninth will land in nisst and join with the conscript forcesthe empress trusts the latter reinforcements will be sufficient to break the crimson guard at fox pass thus opening broods flankthen the empress is a fool dujek said his tone hard the conscripts are next to useless adjunct and by this time next year the crimson guard will have liberated nisst treet one eye cat porule garalt andi know the list lorn rose abruptly youll receive two more legions next year high fist thats itdujek thought for a time his gaze on the map pegged to the table toplorn waited she knew he was lost in reordering reevaluating his plans for next seasons campaign that hed entered a world of materiel and divisions in secondguessing caladan brood and the commander of the crimson guard prince kazz finally he cleared his throat adjunct is it possible to reverse the landings the eleventh and the wickan lancers disembarking on the east coast south of apple the ninth on the west coast to tulipslorn strode to the table and studied the map tulips why there that made no sense at all the empress would be curious as to your revised plans high fistmeaning maybe dujek rubbed the stubble on his jaw then gave a sharp nod all right adjunct first the conscripts will not hold fox pass the crimson guard will be into the northlands by the time our reinforcements arrive much of that area is farmland pasture as we retreat pulling the conscripts back to nisst we raze the countryside no crops no livestock whatever supplies kazz will need hell have to bring with him now adjunct any army on the move any army pursuing a routed army is bound to leave its supply train behind string it out in its haste to catch its enemy and deliver the killing blow and thats where the wickan lancers come inthe wickan were born raiders lorn knew in such countryside theyd be elusive striking quickly and with deadly consequences and the eleventh where will they be in all thisa third will be stationed in nisst the rest will be on the quick marchto fox passwhile caladan brood remains south of blackdog forest that doesnt make sense high fistyou suggested using the moranth for all its worth didnt you well from tulips the moranth and their quorl will be staging a massive liftdujeks gaze narrowed as he studied the map i want the ninth south of blackdog swamp by the time i bring up my forces from here and place them south of brood a concerted push from the gold and black should push him right into our laps while his allies the crimson guard are stuck on the wrong side of fox passyou intend to transport an entire legion by airdoes the empress want this war won in her lifetime or not he pushed himself away from the table and paced mind you he said as if struck by sudden doubts it may all be academic if i were brood idhis voice trailed away and he faced the adjunct will the transport orders be reversedlorn searched his face something told her that the high fist had just made an intuitive leap and it had to do with caladan brood and that as far as dujek was concerned it was indeed now academic she also realized that this was something he wouldnt share with her she scanned the map again trying to see what dujek had seen but it was hopeless she was no tactician trying to guess dujeks thoughts was hard enough but to try the same with caladan brood was impossible your plan although brash is now officially accepted on behalf of the empress your request will be fulfilleddujek nodded halfheartedlyone thing high fist before tayschrenn arrives there was a hound of shadow hereyes the man said i wasnt here at the time but i saw the mess the beast left behind if not for tattersail it wouldve been far worselorn saw a glint of horror in dujeks eyes and into her mind returned the scene from the coast road west of itko kan two years ago ive seen the work of hounds before she said meeting his eyesin that moment of locked gazes they shared something profound then dujek pulled his eyes away this tattersail lorn said to hide a pang of regret must be a very capable sorceressthe only cadre mage to have survived tayschrenns assault on moons spawn dujek repliedindeed to lorn that revelation was even more remarkable she wondered if dujek suspected anything but his next words put her at easeshe called it luck on both counts and she might be righthas she been a cadre mage for a long time lorn askedever since i took command perhaps eight nine yearsthe familiarity of tattersails name returned to lorn then like a mailed fist clenching her heart she found herself sitting down again and dujek had taken a step towards her genuine concern in his eyesyour injury needs attending to he said gruffly i shouldnt have waitedno no its all right weariness thats allhe studied her quizzically would you like some wine adjunctshe nodded tattersail was it possible she would know when she saw the woman she would know then nine years she murmured the mousei beg your pardonshe looked up to find dujek before her he offered her a goblet of wine nothing she said as she accepted it thank youas the double doors swung open both turned in strode tayschrenn his face dark with fury as he confronted dujekdamn you the high mage grated if you had a hand in this ill find it and that is a promisedujek raised an eyebrow a hand in what high mage he asked coollyive just been to the hall of records a fire the place looks like the inside of an ovenlorn rose and stepped between them high mage tayschrenn she said in a low dangerous tone perhaps you could tell me why this matter of some fire in some bureaucrats chamber should override all other considerationstayschrenn blinked i beg your pardon adjunct he said tightly but within the hall of records were the citys census lists his dark eyes swung past her to fix on dujek wherein all the names of pales nobility could be foundunfortunate the high fist said have you begun an investigation my staffs services are of course entirely at your disposalunnecessary high fist the wizard drawled sardonically why make all your other spies redundant tayschrenn paused then stepped back and bowed to lorn greetings adjunct i apologize for this ungraciousseeming reunionsave your apologies for later lorn said levelly she faced dujekthank you for the wine and conversation she said noting with satisfaction tayschrenns stiffening at that i trust therell be a formal dinner this eveningdujek nodded of course adjunctwould you be so kind as to request tattersails attendance as wellshe felt yet another flinch come from the high mage and saw in dujeks gaze a new respect as he looked upon her as if acknowledging her own skills in this brand of tacticstayschrenn interrupted adjunct the sorceress has been ill as a result of her encounter with the hound of shadow he turned a smile on dujek which im sure has been described to you by the high fistnot well enough lorn thought ruefully but let tayschrenn imagine the worst im interested in a wizards evaluation of that event high mage she saidwhich you shall have shortlydujek bowed i will inquire as to tattersails health adjunct if you will excuse me then i can be on my way he turned to tayschrenn and gave a curt nodtayschrenn watched the onearmed old man leave the room then waited for the doors to close once again adjunct this situation isabsurd lorn finished hotly dammit tayschrenn wheres your sense youve taken on the craftiest bastard the empire military has ever had the privilege of possessing and hes eating you alive she spun to the table and refilled her goblet and you deserve itadjunctshe faced him no listen tayschrenn i speak directly from the empress she reluctantly approved your commandeering the assault on moons spawnbut if shed known you so thoroughly lacked subtlety she would never have permitted it do you take everyone else for foolsdujek is just one man tayschrenn saidlorn took a large mouthful of wine then set down the goblet and rubbed her brow dujeks not the enemy she said wearily dujeks never been the enemytayschrenn stepped forward he was the emperors man adjunctchallenging that mans loyalty to the empire is insulting and its that very insult that may well turn him dujek is not just one man right now hes ten thousand and in a years time hell be twentyfive thousand he doesnt yield when you push does he no because he cant hes got ten thousand soldiers behind himand believe me when they get angry enough to push back youll not be able to withstand them as for dujek hell just end up being carried on the tidethen he is a traitorno hes a man who cares for those he is responsible for and to hes the best of the empire if hes forced to turn tayschrenn then were the traitors am i getting throughthe high mages face was lined with a deep disturbed frown yes adjunct he said quietly you are he looked up this task the empress has commanded of me it weighs heavily adjunct these are not my strengths it would do well if you dismissed melorn gave that serious consideration mages by nature never commanded loyalty fear yes and the respect born of fear but the one thing a mage found difficult to understand or cope with was loyalty and yet there had been one mage long ago who had commanded loyaltyand that was the emperor she said high mage we are all agreed on one thing the old guard must disappear all who stood with the emperor and still cling to his memory will ever work against us whether consciously or unconsciously dujek is an exception and there is a handful of others like him those we must not lose as for the others they have to die the risk lies in alerting them to that fact if were too open we may end up with an insurrection the size of which could destroy the empireapart from dujek and tattersail tayschrenn said weve cleaned out everyone else as for whiskeyjack and his squad hes all yours adjunctwith luck lorn said then frowned as the high mage wincedwhats the matterhe rose i peruse my deck of dragons nightly he said and im certain that oponn has entered the world of mortal affairs tattersails own reading did much to confirm my suspicionslorn looked at him sharply shes an adeptfar more adept than i tayschrenn admittedlorn thought what can you tell me of oponns involvementdarujhistan tayschrenn repliedlorn closed her eyes i was afraid youd say that we need darujhistandesperately its wealth coming into our hands would break this continents backi know adjunct but the matter is even worse than you realize i also believe that somehow whiskeyjack and tattersail are in league with one anotherany word of what happened to captain parannone someone is hiding him or his body im inclined to believe hes dead adjunct but his soul has yet to pass through hoods gate and only a mage could prevent thattattersailthe high mage shrugged possibly i would know more of this captains role in all thislorn hesitated then said he was engaged in a long arduous searchtayschrenn growled perhaps he found whatever he was seekinglorn eyed him perhaps tell me how good is tattersailgood enough to be a high mage tayschrenn said good enough to survive a hounds attack and to drive it away though i would not think such a thing possible even i would have difficulty managing thatmaybe she had help lorn murmuredi hadnt thought of thatthink on it now lorn said but before you do the empress requests that you continue your efforts though not against dujekyoure needed here as a conduit in case my mission goes wrong in darujhistan do not involve yourself with managing the occupation of pale further you are to provide dujek with details on oponns appearance if a god has entered the fray he has a right to know and to plan accordinglyhow can one plan anything with oponn in the gameleave that to dujek she studied his face do you have difficulty with any of these instructionstayschrenn smiled in truth adjunct im greatly relievedlorn nodded good now i need a mundane healer and quartersof course tayschrenn strode to the doors then paused and turnedadjunct i am glad youre herethank you high mage after he left lorn sank into her chair and her mind travelled back nine years to the sights and sounds experienced by a child to a night one particular night in the mouse when every nightmare a young girls imagination could hold became real she remembered blood blood everywhere and the empty faces of her mother her father and older brotherfaces numbed by the realization that theyd been spared that the blood wasnt their own as the memories stalked once again through her mind a name rode the winds rustling in the air as if clawing through dead branches lorns lips parted and she whispered tattersailthe sorceress had found the strength to leave her bed she now stood at the window leaning with one hand against the frame for support and looked down on a street crowded with military wagons the systematic plunder that quartermasters called resupply was well under way the eviction of nobility and gentry from their familial estates for the stationing of the officer corps of which she was one had ended days ago while the repairing of the outer walls the refitting of sundered gates and the clearing of moon rain continued apaceshe was glad shed missed the river of corpses that must have filled the city streets during the initial phase of cleanupwagon after wagon groaning beneath the weight of crushed bodies white flesh seared by fire and slashed by sword ratgnawed and ravenpeckedmen women and children it was a scene she had witnessed before and she had no wish ever to see it againnow shock and terror had seeped down and out of sight scenes of normality reappeared as farmers and merchants emerged from hiding to meet the needs of occupiers and occupied alike malazan healers had swept the city rooting out the birthing of plague and treating common ailments among all those they touched no citizen would have been turned from their path and sentiments began the long perfectly planned swingsoon tattersail knew thered be the culling of the nobility a scourge that would raise to the gallows the greediest leastliked nobles and the executions would be public a tried and true procedure that swelled recruitment on a tide of base vengeancewith every hand stained by a righteous glee a sword in such hands completed the conspiracy and included all players in the hunt for the next victim to the causethe empires causeshed seen it run its course in a hundred such cities no matter how benign the original rulers no matter how generous the nobility the word of empire weighted by might twisted the past into a tyranny of demons a sad comment on humanity a bitter lesson made foul by her own role in itin her mind returned the faces of the bridgeburners a strange counterpoint to the cynicism with which she viewed all around herwhiskeyjack a man pushed to the edge or rather the edge creeping on him on all sides a crumbling of beliefs a failing of faiths leaving as his last claim to humanity his squad a shrinking handful of the only people that mattered any more but he held on and he pushed backpushed back hard she liked to thinkno she wanted to believehe would win out in the end that hed live to see his world stripped of the empirequick ben and kalam seeking to take the responsibility from their sergeants shoulders it was their only means of loving the man though theyd never put it in such terms in the others barring sorry she saw the same yet with them there was a desperation that she found endearing a childlike yearning to relieve whiskeyjack of everything their grim place had laid upon himshe responded to them in a way deeper than shed thought possible from a core shed long been convinced was burned out the ashes scattered in silent lamenta core no mage could afford tattersail recognized the danger but that only made it all the more alluringsorry was another matter and she found herself avoiding even thinking about that young womanand that left paran what to do about this captain at the moment the man was in the room seated on the bed behind her and oiling his sword chance theyd not spoken much since shed awakened four days agothere was still too much distrustperhaps it was that mystery that uncertainty that made them so attracted to one another and the attraction was obvious even now with her back to the man she sensed a taut thread between them whatever energy burned between them it felt dangerous which made it excitingtattersail sighed hairlock had appeared this very morning eager and agitated about something the puppet would not answer their queries but the sorceress suspected that hairlock had found a trail and it seemed it might take the puppet out of pale and on to darujhistanthat was not a happy thoughtshe stiffened as the ward shed placed outside her door was trippedtattersail whirled to paran a visitor she saidhe rose chance in his handsthe sorceress waved her hand over him youre no longer visible captain nor can anyone sense your presence make no sound and wait here she strode into the outer room just as a soft knock sounded on the doorshe opened it to see a young marine standing in the hallway what is it she demandedthe marine bowed high fist dujek is inquiring as to your health sorceressmuch better she said thats kind of him now if youllthe marine interrupted diffidently if you answered as you just have i am to convey the high fists request that you attend a formal supper this evening in the main buildingtattersail cursed silently she shouldnt have told the truth now it was too late a request from her commander was not something that could be denied inform the high fist that i will be honoured to share his company over supper a thought struck her may i ask who else will be presenthigh mage tayschrenn a messenger named toc the younger and adjunct lornadjunct lorn is herearrived this morning sorceressoh hoods breath convey my reply tattersail said struggling against a rising tide of fear she shut the door then heard the marines boots hurrying down the hallwaywhats wrong paran asked from the opposite doorwayshe faced him put that sword away captain she walked over to the dresser and began rummaging through the drawers im to attend a dinner she saidparan approached an official gatheringtattersail nodded distractedly with adjunct lorn there as well as if tayschrenn isnt bad enoughthe captain murmured so shes finally arrivedtattersail froze she turned to him slowly youve been expecting her havent youparan started and looked at her with frightened eyesshe realized his mumbling hadnt been meant for her ears dammit she hissed youre working for herthe captains answer was clear as he spun round she watched him vanish into the bedroom her thoughts a storm of fury the threads of conspiracy now thrummed in her mind so quick bens suspicions had been accurate a plan was afoot to kill the squad did that make her life at risk as well she felt herself nearing a decision what that decision was she wasnt sure but there was a direction to her thoughts now and it had the inevitable momentum of an avalanchethe seventh bell was ringing from some distant tower as toc the younger passed into the empire headquartershe showed his invitation to yet another grimfaced intense guard and was grudgingly allowed to continue on down the main hall to the dining chamber unease churned in tocs stomach he knew the adjunct was behind the request but she could be as unpredictable and as manipulative as the rest beyond the doors he now approached might as well be a pit filled with vipers all hungrily awaiting his arrivaltoc wondered if hed be able to keep anything down and knowing the condition of his facial wound he then wondered grimly if anyone else would be able to keep anything down among his fellow soldiers his scars were barely noticed rare was the soldier in dujeks army who did not carry a scar or three those few friends he had seemed simply thankful that he still livedin the seven cities superstition held that loss of an eye was also the birth of inner sight hed been reminded of that belief at least a dozen times in the last couple of weeks there had been no secret gift granted him in exchange for his eye flashes of searing light ripped through his mind every now and then but he suspected that was no more than a memory of the last thing his eye had seen fireand now he was about to sit among the loftiest company in the empire barring the empress herself suddenly the wound was a thing of shame hed sit there as testament to the horrors of wartoc stiffened just outside the dining room door was that why the adjunct had invited him he hesitated then shrugged and entereddujek tayschrenn and the adjunct turned as one to regard him toc the younger bowedthank you for coming adjunct lorn said she stood with the two men near the largest of three fireplaces in the wall opposite the entrance please join us were now awaiting but one more guesttoc strode to them thankful for dujeks grin the high fist set his crystal goblet down on the mantel and deliberately scratched the stump of his left armbet its driving you half crazed the old man said his grin broadeningi scratch with both hands toc saiddujek barked a laugh join us in a drinkthank you he noticed lorns appraisal as he accepted a goblet from dujek taking the decanter from a nearby table his glance crossed the high mage but tayschrenns attention was fixed on the roaring fire behind lornhas your horse recovered the adjunct askedtoc nodded as he filled his goblet doing handstands the last time i looked in on her he saidlorn smiled tentatively as if unsure whether he was mocking her ive explained your vital role in keeping me alive toc the younger how you loosed four arrows on the fly and brought down four barghasthe looked at her sharply i didnt know i had the last two shots in me he said he sipped wine resisting the urge to scratch his wounddujek grunted your father was also in the habit of surprising people theres a man i missi too toc replied looking downthe awkward silence that followed this exchange was mercifully broken by the arrival of the last guest toc turned with the others as the door swung open he gazed at the woman standing in the entrance then started was that tattersail hed never seen her wearing anything but battle garb and was now stunned my he thought wonderingly shes not bad if you like them big that is he half grinnedlorns response to tattersails appearance had sounded much like a gasp then she spoke we have met before though i doubt youd remembertattersail blinked i think i would have recalled that she said cautiouslyi think not i was but eleven years old at the timethen you must be mistaken im rarely in the company of childrenthey burned the mouse quarter a week after you swept through it tattersail lorns voice made everyone stiffen with its barely controlled rage those survivors the ones you left behind were resettled in mocks hole and in those plagueridden caverns my mother my father and my brother diedthe blood drained from tattersails round facebewildered toc glanced at the others dujeks expression was masked but there was a storm behind his eyes as he studied lorn on tayschrenns face as he looked upon the sorceress there dawned a sudden lightit was our first command tattersail said quietlytoc saw lorn trembling and held his breath but when she spoke it was controlled the words precise an explanation is required she turned to high fist dujek they were recruits a cadre of mages they were in malaz city awaiting their new commander when the master of the claw issued an edict against sorcery they were sent into the old citythe mouseto cleanse it they were her voice caught indiscriminate she swung her attention back to tattersail this woman was one of those mages sorceress that night was my last with my family i was given to the claw the very next day the news of my familys death was kept from me for years yet her words fell to a whisper i well remember that nightthe blood the screamstattersail seemed unable to speak the air in the room had grown thick stifling finally the sorceress prised her gaze from the adjunct and said to dujek high fist it was our first command we lost control i resigned from the officer corps the very next day and was posted with another army she gathered herself if it is the adjuncts wish to convene a court i offer no defence and will accept my execution as a just penaltylorn replied that is acceptable she laid her left hand upon her sword and prepared to withdraw itno high fist dujek said it is not acceptablelorn froze she glared at the old man you seem to forget my rankno i havent adjunct if it is your will that those within the empire who have committed crimes in the emperors name must be executed he stepped forward then you must include me indeed i believe high mage tayschrenn also has his share of horror committed on the emperors behalf and finally there is the empress herself to considerlaseen after all commanded the emperors clawshe created it in fact more the edict was hers thankfully shortlived as it was he turned to tattersail i was there tattersail under whiskeyjacks command i was sent down to rein you in which i didshe shook her head whiskeyjack commanded her eyes narrowed this has the taste of a gods gamedujek swung back to the adjunct the empire has its history and we each are in itin this tayschrenn rasped i must agree with the high fist adjuncttheres no need to have all this official tattersail said her eyes on lorn i hereby challenge you to a duel on my behalf i shall employ all my magical skills in an effort to destroy you you may defend with your sword adjuncttoc took a step forward he opened his mouth then closed it again hed been about to tell tattersail that lorn carried an otataral sword that the duel would be grossly unfair that shed die within seconds as the sword devoured her every spell then he saw that the sorceress knew all thatdujek rounded on tattersail dammit woman do you think everything hinges on how its worded execution duel none of it matters one whit all that the adjunct does all that she says is on behalf of empress laseen he spun to lorn you are here as laseens voice as her will adjuncttayschrenn spoke softly the woman named lorn the woman who once was a child who once had a family he looked upon the adjunct with anguish in his eyes that woman does not exist she ceased to exist the day she became the adjunctlorn stared at the two men her eyes widestanding beside her toc watched those words battering her will crushing the anger shattering into dust every last vestige of identity and from her eyes rose the icy clinical repose of the adjunct to the empresstoc felt his heart pounding hard against his chest hed just witnessed an execution the woman named lorn had risen from the turgid mists of the past risen to right a wrong to find justice and in that last act reclaim its lifeand she had been denied not by the words of dujek or tayschrenn but by the thing known as the adjunctof course she said removing her hand from her sword please enter sorceress tattersail and dine with usthe flat tone of her voice told toc that her invitation had not cost anythingand this horrified him shook him to his very core a quick glance showed a similar response from tayschrenn and dujek though the latter veiled ittattersail looked positively ill but she nodded shakily in answer to the adjuncts invitationtoc found the decanter and a spare crystal goblet he walked up to the sorceress i am toc the younger he said smiling and you need a drink he poured the glass full and handed it to her often when we camped on the march id see you lugging that travelling wardrobe of yours around now i finally see what was in it sorceress youre a sight for a sore eyea look of gratitude entered tattersails gaze she raised an eyebrow i hadnt realized my travelling wardrobe garnered such attentiontoc grinned im afraid youve provided a standing joke in the secondanything surprising be it an ambush or an unplanned skirmishthe enemy invariably came from your travelling wardrobe sorceressdujek guffawed behind him ive often wondered where that phrase came from and damn i heard it a loteven from my officersthe atmosphere in the room relaxed somewhat though undercurrents of tension still swirled they seemed to be between tattersail and high mage tayschrenn the sorceress turned her gaze upon lorn whenever the adjuncts attention was elsewhere and toc could see the compassion there and his respect for her rose considerably in her shoes any look he gave lorn would have been filled with fear and whatever storm threatened between tattersail and tayschrenn seemed born of a difference in opinion coupled with suspicion it didnt look personalthen again toc considered dujeks steady presence may have been providing the levelling influence his father had spoken much of dujek of a man who never lost his touch with the powerless or the less powerful in dealing with the former he always made his own failings an easy recognition and with the latter he had an unerring eye that cut away personal ambition with the precision of a surgeon removing septic flesh leaving in its place someone who treated trust and honesty as givensstudying dujeks easy relaxed rapport with the others in attendance including himself and then with the servants who filed in bearing trays of food it struck toc that the man had not changed perceptibly from the one toc the elder had called friend and that impressed toc deeply knowing as he did the pressures that burdened the high fistas soon as everyone was seated and the first course presented it was adjunct lorn who took command however dujek relinquished it without a word or a gesture evidently confident that the earlier incident was now over as far as the adjunct was concernedlorn addressed tattersail in that uncanny flat voice sorceress permit me to compliment you on besting a hound of shadow and on your timely recovery i know that tayschrenn has questioned you regarding this incident but i would like to hear the tale from you directlytattersail set down her goblet and regarded her plate briefly before meeting the adjuncts steady gaze as the high mage may have explained its now clear that the gods have entered the fray specifically theyve become involved with the empires plans for darujhistantoc rose quickly i believe he said i should excuse myself now as what will be discussed here exceedsbe seated toc the younger lorn commanded you are the claw representative here and as such you are responsible for speaking on its behalfi amyou areslowly toc satplease continue sorceresstattersail nodded oponn is central to this gambit the twin jesters opening move has created ripplesim sure the high mage would agree with thisand thus attracted the attention of other godsshadowthrone lorn said she looked to tayschrennthe high mage concurred one could expect such a thing i however have sensed nothing of shadowthrones attention upon us even though i pursued that possibility vigorously after the hounds attacklorn exhaled slowly sorceress please go onthe hounds presence was triggered entirely by accident tattersail said flicking a glance at tayschrenn i was doing a reading from my deck of dragons and came upon the card of the hound as with all adepts i found the image animate to a certain extent when i gave it my full concentration it felt she cleared her throat as if a portal opened created entirely from the other side of that cardfrom high house shadow itself she raised her hands and gazed steadily at the high mage is this possible the shadow realm is new among the houses its full power not yet expressed well whatever happeneda portal a rentthe hound gear appearedthen why tayschrenn asked did it appear in the street why not in your roomtattersail smiled i can speculateplease do the adjunct saidi have wards about my room tattersail said the innermost of these are high thyrtayschrenn started at that clearly surprisedsuch wards tattersail continued create a flux a tide of power that surges and ebbs like a pulsing heart one that is beating very fast i suspect that these wards were sufficient to bounce the hound away from my immediate area since in its transitional statehalfway between its realm and oursthe hound could not fully express its powers once it had arrived however it could and it didhow did you manage to fend off a hound of shadow tayschrenn askedluck tattersail replied without hesitation her answer hung in the air and it seemed to toc that everyone had forgotten their mealin other words lorn said slowly you believe that oponn intervenedi dowhytattersail barked a laugh if i could work that out adjunct id be a happy woman as it is her humour fell away it seems were being used the empire itself has become a pawnis there a way out dujek asked his words a growl that startled everyonetattersail shrugged if there is it lies in darujhistan since thats where oponns gambit seems centred mind you high fist drawing us into darujhistan might well be what oponn seeks to achievetoc sat back absently scratching his wound there was more to it he suspected though he could find no discernible source for his suspicionhe scratched harder tattersail could be glib when she wanted to be her story had a straightforwardness to it the best lies were the simple onesstill nobody else seemed unduly suspicious the sorceress had shifted attention from her story to its implications for future action she had everyone thinking past her and the faster their thoughts raced the further behind they left their doubts about herhe watched her watching the others and was the only one to notice the flash of triumph and relief in her eyes when lorn spokeoponn is not the first god seeking to manipulate the malazan empire the adjunct said others have failed come away bloodied its unfortunate the lesson was lost on opornnand on shadowthrone for that matter she sighed deeply tattersail whatever your differences with the high mage it is necessary no vital that you work together in seeking to discover the details of oponns intervention in the meantime high fist dujek will continue preparing his legion to march as well as solidifying our hold on pale for myself i will be leaving the city shortly rest assured my mission has goals identical to yours now one last thing she turned to toc i wish to hear the claws evaluation of the words that have been exchanged herehe stared in surprise hed assumed the role she had expected of him without even realizing it he sat straight and glanced at tattersail she now looked nervous drawing her hands beneath the table he waited until their gazes locked and held before he turned to the adjunctin so far as she knows it the sorceress speaks the truth he said her speculations were genuine although concerning the dynamics of magic im at a loss perhaps high mage tayschrenn could comment on thatlorn seemed vaguely disappointed with tocs evaluation but she nodded anyway and said accepted then high magetayschrenn released a slow breath accurate he said speculation is soundtoc refilled his goblet the first course was removed almost untouched but as the second course arrived everyone turned their full attention to it and conversation ceased toc ate slowly avoiding tattersails eyes though he sensed them upon him time and again he wondered at his own actions deceiving the adjunct to the empress the high mage and the high fist all in one shot struck him as rash if not suicidal and his reasons for doing so were not entirely rational which made it all the more distressinghe ner esd adhe ce for ces in e im er she is st full he the not ch the nd had a long bloody history more times than toc could count someone had come through for someone else whatever the odds and more often than not it had been the mage cadre hed been there on the plain outside pale and hed watched with a thousand others the cadre being torn apart hopelessly outmatched that kind of waste didnt sit well with the nd and though he was a claw the faces that surrounded him the faces that looked upon him in hope despair andat timesfatal resignation those faces had been mirrors of his own and they defied the claw at every turn the years in the claw where feeling and caring had been systematically assailed those years failed to withstand the dayin dayout reality that was the nd armythis night and with his words toc had given something back to tattersail not just for her but for the cadre it didnt matter if she understood and he knew she must be feeling bewildered by his actions none of that mattered what hed done hed done for himselfhe sat up now thats odd he thought my wounds stopped itchingfeeling lightheaded tattersail wobbled every now and then as she walked down the hall towards the door to her room she knew it wasnt the wine with her nerves as frayed as they were that fine vintage had tasted like water and had had as much effectadjunct lorn had raised in the sorceress memories shed spent years burying for lorn it had been a pivotal event but for tattersail it had been just one nightmare among many still it had pushed her where other crimes had not and as a result shed found herself attached to the nd armythe army shed been sent to as a recruit the closing of a circle but in that time she had changedthat attachment those twentyodd years of service had this night saved her life she knew that toc the younger had lied for her and the look he had given her prior to stating his evaluation had been a message shed understood though he had come to the nd as a claw as a spy not even his years of training within that secret organization could withstand the new world in which hed found himselftattersail understood this all too clearly for the same had happened to her the sorceress in a cadre of mages who had entered the mouse quarter so long ago had cared naught for anyone but herself even her attempt to cut herself away from the horrors of which shed been part had been born of a selfish desire to flee to absolve her own consciencebut the empire had denied her in this an old soldier had come to her the day after the slaughter in the mouse quarter old nameless a veteran sent to convince the sorceress that she was still needed she well remembered his words should you ever outrun the guilt within your past sorceress you will have outrun your soul when it finds you again it will kill you and then rather than deny her desperate needs absolutely hed sent her into a veteran army the th until the time came for her to returnto the nd to a place under the command of dujek onearm with that shed been given a second chancetattersail came to her door and paused to sense the condition of her wards all was well sighing she entered her room then leaned against the door as it closed behind hercaptain paran stepped out from the bedroom his expression wan and somehow shy not under arrest im surprisedso am i she repliedhairlock was here paran said he instructed me to give you a messagetattersail studied the mans face seeking a hint of what he was about to deliver he avoided her gaze and remained standing near the doorway into the bedroom well she demandedparan cleared his throat first he was uh excited he knew of adjuncts arrival and said she wasnt alonenot alone did he explain thatparan shrugged said the dust walks around the adjunct the d shifts beneath her boots and the wind whispers of frost and fire he raised his eyebrows does that explain anything damned if i knowtattersail strode to her dresser she began to remove the scant jewellery shed donned for the dinner i think it does she said slowly did he say anything elsehe did he said that the adjunct and her companion were leaving pale soon and that he intended to track them sorceressshe saw that paran was struggling with something as if fighting his every instinct tattersail laid one arm on the dresser and waited when he met her gaze her breath caught you were about to say something she said her voice low her heart was pounding all too fast and she felt her body responding as if of its own accord the look shed seen in his eyes had been clear in its meaningi know something of the adjuncts mission he said i was to be her contact in darujhistanwhatever had been building between them disintegrated as tattersails eyes went hard and anger darkened her face shes going to darujhistan is she and you and she were to oversee the longawaited demise of the bridgeburners together you thought youd be able to kill whiskeyjack to cut down his squad from withinno paran took a step forward but when tattersail shot out her hand palm facing him he froze wait he whispered before you do anything just hear me outher thyr warren surged into her hand eager for release why damn oponn for letting you livetattersail please she scowled speakparan stepped back and turned to a nearby chair hands held out at his sides he sat down and looked up at herkeep those hands there tattersail commanded away from your swordthis has been the adjuncts personal mission from the very start three years ago i was stationed in itko kan officers corps one day every available soldier was mustered out and marched to a section of the coast road parans hands had begun to shake and the muscles of his jaw stood out what we saw there tattersail you would not believeshe recalled quick ben and kalams story a massacre a company cavalryastonishment showed on parans face how did you knowgo on captain she gratedadjunct lorn arrived from the capital and took charge she guessed that the massacre had been a a diversion we began upon a trail it was not a clear one not at first sorceress may i lower my armsslowly on the chair arms captainhe sighed gratefully and set down his trembling forearms as shed instructed anyway the adjunct determined that a girl had been taken possessed by a godwhich godparan made a face come now if you know of the massacre is it hard to guess that company was killed by shadow hounds which god well shadowthrone comes to mind he said sarcastically the adjunct believes shadowthrone was involved but the god that possessed the girl was the ropei know of no other name for himthe patron of assassins shadowthrones companiontattersail dropped her arm shed closed her warren a minute earlier since it had begun to push hard and she had feared she didnt have the strength to resist it much longer youve found the girl she stated dullyvacant a at forward yesatt names sorryyoure aware of this paran said sinking back into the chair which means that whiskeyjack is also aware since who else could have told you he looked up into her eyes with a clouded expression im now very confusedyoure not alone tattersail said so all thisyour arrival the adjunctsit was all a hunt for the girl she shook her head thats not enough it cant be enough captainits all that im aware of tattersailshe studied him for a moment i believe you tell me what are the details of the adjuncts missioni dont know paran said tossing up his hands somehow i was the one shed be able to find so my being with the squad would bring her to the girlthe adjuncts talents are many tattersail mused through the antithesis of sorcery she might well possess the ability to have linked with you especially if youve been in her company for the past two yearsthen why isnt she breaking down your doortattersails eyes were on the jewellery scattered on the dresser oponn severed the link captaini dislike the thought of exchanging one set of shackles for another paran grumbledtheres more to this tattersail insisted more to herself than to the captain lorn has a tlan imass with herparan jerked uprighthairlocks snide hints she explained i believe the mission was twofold kill sorry yes but also kill whiskeyjack and his squad the tlan would not be involved if her plan concerned just you her otataral sword is sufficient to destroy sorry and possibly kill the rope as well assuming thats whos possessing the girli would not like to believe that paran said they are my command my responsibility the adjunct would not betray me sowouldnt she why notthe captain seemed at a loss to answer her but there was a stubborn glower in his eyestattersail reached the decision she had sensed was coming and it left her cold hairlock left too early the puppet was eager too eager to pursue the adjunct and that tlan imass he must have discovered something about them about what theyre up towho is hairlocks master paran askedquick ben whiskeyjacks mage she looked to him hes the best ive seen not the most powerful mind you but smart still if the tlan imass comes on him unawares he wont stand a chance and neither will the rest she paused her eyes holding on the captain i have to leave pale she said abruptlyparan shot to his feet not alonealone tattersail insisted i have to find whiskeyjack and if youre tagging along then lorn will find him tooi refuse to believe the adjunct presents any risk to the sergeant paran said tell me can you succeed in killing sorry even with quick bens helpthe sorceress hesitated im not sure i want to she said slowlywhatit has to be whiskeyjacks decision captain and i dont think i can give any good reason for convincing you of that i just feel its rightshe felt herself relying on instinct in this matter but vowed to hold true to iteven so paran said i cant remain hiding here can i what do i eat the beddingi can get you out into the city tattersail said none will recognize you take a room in an inn and stay out of your uniform if all goes well ill be back in two weeks you can wait that long cant you captainparan stared and what happens if i just walk out of here and introduce myself to dujek onearmthe high mage tayschrerm would shred your brain with truthseeking sorcery captain youve oponns touch and after tonight oponn is now an official enemy of the empire and when tayschrenns done hell leave you to die which is preferable to the madness that would grip you if he kept you alive hell show that mercy at least tattersail anticipated parans thoughts dujek might well seek to protect you but in this tayschrenn outranks him youve become a tool of oponn and for dujek the safety of his soldiers takes precedence over his pleasure in frustrating tayschrenn so in fact he might not protect you at all im sorry captain but youre truly alone if you walkill be alone when you leave too sorceressi know but it wont be for ever she searched his eyes and felt compassion welling behind her own paran she said its not all bad despite all the distrust between us im feeling things for you i havent felt for anyone inwell in some time she smiled sadly i dont know what thats worth captain but im glad i said it anywayparan gazed at her for a long minute then said very well tattersail ill do as you ask an inn do you have some local coineasily acquired her shoulders slumped im sorry but im exhausted as she turned to the bedroom her gaze fell on the dressertop one last time amid a small pile of underclothing she saw her deck of dragons it would be foolish not to do a reading considering the decision shed madeparan spoke close behind her tattersail how thorough is your exhaustionshe felt the heat in his words triggering a smouldering fire beneath her stomach and her gaze slid away from the deck as she turned to face the captain though she voiced no reply to his question her answer was clear he took her hand surprising her with such an innocent gesture so young she thought and now hes leading me into the bedroom she would have laughed if the act hadnt been so sweetfalse dawn played the eastern horizon as adjunct lorn guided her mount and packhorse out from pales east gate true to dujeks words the guards were nowhere in sight and the gate had been left open she hoped the few sleepy eyes that had followed her through the streets had only mild curiosity behind them in any case she was dressed in simple unadorned leather armour her face was mostly hidden in the shadow cast by the plain bronze helmets browguard even her horses were a local breed sturdy and placid much smaller than the malazan warhorses with which she was most familiar but a comforting ride none the less it seemed unlikely that she would have attracted undue attention more than one unemployed mercenary had left pale since the empires arrivalthe south horizon was a jagged line of snowcapped mountains the tahlyn mountains would remain on her right for some time before the rhivi plain swept past them and became the catlin plain few farms broke the flatlands around her and those that did crowded the citys own lands the rhivi people were not tolerant of such encroachments and since every trade route that led to and from pale crossed their traditional territory those of the city wisely refrained from angering the rhiviahead as she walked her horses the dawn showed its face with a streak of crimson the rain had passed a few days back and the sky overhead was silverblue and clear a few stars dwindling as light came to the worldthe day promised to be hot the adjunct loosened the leather thongs between her breasts revealing the fine mail hauberk beneath by midday she would reach the first wellspring where she would replenish her supply of water she ran a hand across the surface of one of the bladders strapped to her saddle it came away wet with condensation she passed her hand across her lipsthe voice that spoke beside her jolted her in the saddle and her mount snorted in fear and sidesteppedi will walk with you onos toolan said for a timelorn glared at the tlan imass i would rather you announced your arrival she said tightly from a distanceas you wish onos toolan sank into the ground like so much dustthe adjunct cursed then she saw him waiting a hundred yards ahead of her backlit by the rising sun the crimson sky seemed to have cast a red flame about the warrior the effect jangled her nerves as if she looked upon a scene that touched her deepest oldest memoriesmemories that went beyond her own life the tlan imass stood unmoving until she reached him then fell into step beside herlorn tightened her knees about the horses shoulders and closed the reins until the mare settled down do you have to be so literalminded tool she askedthe desiccated warrior seemed to consider then nodded i accept that name all of my history is dead existence begins anew and with it shall be a new name it is suitablewhy were you selected to accompany me the adjunct askedin the lands west and north of seven cities i alone among my clan survived the twentyeighth jaghut warlorns eyes widened i thought those wars numbered twentyseven she said quietly when your legions left us after conquering seven cities and you marched into the wastelandsour bone casters sensed an enclave of surviving jaghut tool said our commander logros tlan determined that we exterminate them thus we didwhich explains your decimated numbers upon returning lorn saidyou could have explained your decision to the empress as it was she was left without her most powerful army and no knowledge of when it might returnreturn was not guaranteed adjunct tool saidlorn stared at the tattered creature i seethe cessation of my clans chieftain kig aven was accompanied by all my kin thus alone i am unbound to logro kig avens bone caster was kilava onass who has been lost since long before the emperor reawakened uslorns mind raced among the malazan empire the tlan imass were also known as the silent host shed never known an imass as loquacious as this tool perhaps it had something to do with this unbounding within the imass only commander logros ever spoke to humans on a regular basis as for the bone castersimass shamansthey stayed out of sight the only one that had ever appeared was one named olar ethil who stood alongside the clan chieftain eitholos ilm during the battle of kartool which had seen an exchange of sorcery that made moons spawn look like a childs cantripin any case shed already learned more of the imass from this brief conversation with tool than was present in the empire annals the emperor had known more much more but making records of such knowledge had never been his style that he had reawakened the imass had been a theory argued among scholars for years and now she knew it to be true how many other secrets would this tlan imass reveal in casual conversationtool she said had you ever met the emperor personallyi awakened before galad ketan and after onak shendok and as with all the tlan imass i knelt before the emperor as he sat upon the first thronethe emperor was alone lorn askedno he was accompanied by the one named dancerdamn she hissed dancer had died beside the emperor where is this first throne toolthe warrior was silent for a time then it said upon the emperors death the logros tlan imass gathered mindsa rare thing that was last done before the diasporaand a binding resulted adjunct the answer to your question is within this binding i cannot satisfy you this holds for all logros tlan imass and for all kron tlan imasswho are the kronthey are coming tool repliedsudden sweat sprang out on the adjuncts brow logros legions when they first arrived on the scene numbered around nineteen thousand they were believed now to number fourteen thousand and the majority of those losses had come beyond the empires borders in this last jaghut war were another nineteen thousand imass about to arrive what had the emperor unleashedtool she asked slowly almost regretting her need to persist in questioning him what is the significance of these kron comingthe year of the three hundredth millennium approaches the warrior repliedwhat happens thenadjunct the diaspora endsthe great raven called crone rode the high winds above rhivi plain the northern horizon was now a greentinged curve growing more substantial with every hour of flight weariness weighed down her wings but the heavens breath was a strong one and more nothing could assail her certainty that changes were coming to this world and she drew again and again upon her vast reserves of magical powerif ever there was a dire convergence of great forces it was now and in this place the gods were descending to the mortal soil to do battle shapings were being forged of flesh and bone and the blood of sorcery now boiled with a madness born of inevitable momentum crone had never felt more alivewith these unveiling of powers heads had turned and to one crone flew in answer to a summons she was powerless to ignore lord anomander rake was not her only master and for her this only made things more interesting as for her own ambitions she would keep them to herself for now knowledge was her powerand if there was one secret more alluring than any other she might covet it was the mystery surrounding the half human warrior called caladan brood anticipation lifted crones wings with renewed strengthsteadily blackdog forest spread its verdant cloak over the northchapter tenkallor said i walked this land when the tlan imass were but children i have commanded armies a hundred thousand strong i have spread the fire of my wrath across entire continents and sat alone upon tall thronesdo you grasp the meaning of thisyes said caladan brood you never learnconversations of war second in command kallor speaking with warlord caladan brood recorded by outrider hurlochel th armyjimkaros inn stood just beyond eltrosan square in the opal quarter of pale that much toc knew from his wanderings through the city but for the life of him he could not think of anyone staying there whom he knew yet the instructions for this mysterious meeting had been clearhe now approached the ostentatious structure warily he saw nothing suspicious the square was crowded with the usual gentry and merchant shops of malazan guards there were few the culling of the nobility had done much to cloak pales atmosphere with a shocked stillness that hung about people like invisible yokesthe past few days toc had kept much to himself carousing with his fellow soldiers when the mood took him though those times seemed rarer these days with the adjunct gone and tattersail reported missing dujek and tayschrenn were involved in mutually exclusive responsibilities the high fist was busy restructuring pale and his newly formed th army while the high mage sought tattersail evidently without much successtoc suspected that the peace between the two men would not lastsince the dinner he had stayed away from anything official choosing to eat with his comrades rather than dine with the officers as was now his privilege as ranking claw the less noticed he made himself the better as far as he was concernedhe entered vimkaros inn and paused before him was a roofless courtyard with paths winding among a rich garden clearly the inn had survived the siege unscathed a wide central path led directly to a broad counter behind which stood a corpulent old man eating grapes a few guests walked the side paths moving among the plants and conversing in low tonesthe message had insisted he come dressed in local garb thus toc drew little attention as he strode to the counterthe old man paused in his snacking and bowed with his head at your service sir he said wiping his handsi believe a table has been reserved in my name toc said i am render kanthe old man studied a wax tablet before him then looked up with a smile of course follow mea minute later toc sat at a table on a balcony overlooking the garden court his only company was a decanter of chilled saltoan wine which arrived when he did and he now sipped from a goblet his lone eye surveying the people in the garden belowa servant arrived and bowed before him kind sir the man said i am to deliver the following message a gentleman will soon join you who has been out of his depth yet not aware of it he is nowtoc frowned thats the messageit ishis own wordsand yours sir the servant bowed again and departedtocs frown deepened then he sat forward his every muscle tensinghe turned to the balconys entrance in time to see captain paran stride through he was dressed in the manner of the local gentry unarmed and looking quite fit toc rose grinningnot unduly shocked i hope paran said as he arrived they sat down and the captain poured himself some wine did the message prepare youbarely toc replied im not sure how to receive you captain is this according to the adjuncts instructionsshe believes me dead paran said his brow wrinkling and i was for a time tell me toc the younger am i speaking to a claw or to a soldier of the secondtocs eye narrowed thats a tough questionis it paran asked his gaze intense and unwaveringtoc hesitated then grinned again hoods breath no it damn well isnt all right captain welcome to the defunct second thenparan laughed clearly relievednow whats all this about you being dead but not dead captainparans humour vanished he took a mouthful of wine and swallowed looking away an attempted assassination he explained grimacing i should have died if not for mallet and tattersailwhat whiskeyjacks healer and the sorceressparan nodded ive been recovering until recently in tattersails quarters whiskeyjacks instructions were to keep my existence secret the time being toc he leaned forward what do you know of the adjuncts planstoc examined the garden below tattersail had knownshe managed to keep it from everyone at the dinner remarkable now said quietly you ask questions of a clawi dowheres tattersail toc swung his gaze to the captain and held the mans eyesthe captain jerked his head very well she travels overlanddarujhistan she knows a tlan imass accompanies the adjunct and she believes lorns plan includes killing whiskeyjack and his squad i do not agree my role in the mission was to keep an eye on one member of the sergeants squad and that person was to be the only one to die she gave me the command after three years of service to herits a reward and i cant believe she would take it from me there that is what i know can you help me tocthe adjuncts mission toc said after releasing a long breath as far as im aware of it involves far more than just killing sorry the tlan imass is with her for something else captain tocs expression was grim the days of the bridgeburners are numbered whiskeyjacks name is damn near sacred among dujeks men this is something of which i couldnt convince the adjunctin fact she seems to think the opposite but if the sergeant and the bridgeburners are eliminated this army wont be pulled back in line it will mutiny and the malazan empire will be against high fist dujek with not a single commander who can match him the genabackan campaign will disintegrate and civil war may well sweep into the heart of the empirethe blood had drained from parans face i believe you he said very well youve taken my doubts and made of them convictions and they leave me with but one choiceand that isparan turned the empty goblet in his hands darujhistan he said with luck ill catch tattersail and together well attempt to contact whiskeyjack before the adjunct does he glanced at toc evidently the adjunct can no longer sense my whereabouts tattersail forbade me to accompany her arguing that lorn would be able to detect me but she also let slip that my death had severed the bonds between me and the adjunct i should have made the connection sooner but she distracted meinto tocs mind returned the memory of how shed looked that evening and he nodded knowingly im sure she didparan sighed yes well in any case i need at least three horses and supplies the adjunct is proceeding on some kind of timetable i know that much so shes not travelling with much haste i should catch up with tattersail in a day or two then together we can drive hard to the edge of the tahlyn mountains skirt them and slip past the adjuncttoc had leaned back during parans elaboration of his plan a halfsmile on his lips youll need wickan horses captain since what youve described requires mounts superior to those the adjuncts riding now how do you plan to get past the city gates dressed as a local but leading empire horsesparan blinkedtoc grinned ive got your answer captain he spread his hands ill go with you leave the horses and supplies to me and i guarantee well get out of the city unnoticedbutthose are my conditions captainparan coughed very well and now that i think on it the company would be welcomegood toc grunted he reached for the decanter lets drink on the damn thing thenthe way was becoming more and more difficult and tattersail felt her first tremor of fear she travelled a warren of high thyr and not even tayschrenn possessed the ability to assail it yet under attack it was not directly the power that opposed her was pervasive and it deadened her sorcerythe warren had become narrow choked with obstacles at times it shuddered around her the dark walls to either side writhing as if under tremendous pressure and within the tunnel she struggled to shape the air stank of something she had difficulty identifying there was a tinge of sour brimstone and a mustiness that reminded her of unearthed tombs it seemed to drain the power from her with every breath she tookshe realized that she could not continue she would have to enter the physical world and find rest once again she cursed her own carelessnessshe had forgotten her deck of dragons with them she would have known what to expect she entertained once again the suspicion that an outside force had acted upon her severing her from the deck the first distraction had come from captain paran and while it had been pleasant she reminded herself that paran belonged to oponn after that shed experienced an unaccountable urgency to be on her way so much so that shed left everything behindbereft of her warren she would find herself alone on the rhivi plain without food without even a bedroll the mindless need for haste shed experienced ran contrary to her every instinct she was growing certain that it had been imposed upon her that somehow shed let her defences down left herself exposed to such manipulations and that returned her thoughts to captain paran to the servant of oponns willfinally she could go no further she began to withdraw her strained power collapsing the warren layer by layer about her the ground beneath her boots became solid cloaked in spare yellow grass and the air around her shifted into the dull lavender of dusk a wind brushed her face smelling of soil the horizon steadied itself on all sidesfar off to her right the sun still bathed the talhyn mountains the peaks glittering like goldand immediately ahead rose an enormous silhouetted figure turning to face her and voicing a surprised grunttattersail stepped back in alarm and the voice that emerged from the figure pushed the air from her lungs in a whooshing breath of relief then terrortattersail bellurdan said sadly tayschrenn did not expect youd manage to come this far thus i was anticipating detecting you from a distance the thelomen giant lifted his arms in an expansive childlike shrug at his feet was a familiar burlap sack though the body within had shrunk since shed last seen ithow has the high mage managed to deny my warren she askedon the heels of her terror had come weariness almost resignationhe could not do that bellurdan answered he simply anticipated that you would attempt to travel to darujhistan and as your thyr warren cannot function over water he concluded you would take this paththen what happened with my warrenbellurdan grunted distastefully the tlan imass who accompanies the adjunct has created around them a dead space our sorcery is devoured by the warriors eldering powers the effect is cumulative if you were to open your warren entirely you would be consumed utterly tattersailthe thelomen stepped forward the high mage has instructed me to arrest you and return you to himand if i resistbellurdan answered in a tone filled with sorrow then i am to kill youi see tattersail thought for a time her world seemed to have closed in now her every memory irrelevant and discarded her heart pounded like a thundering drum in her chest all that remained of her past and her only true sense of her life was regretan unspecified yet overwhelming regret she looked up at the thelomen compassion brimming in her eyes so where are this tlan and the adjunct thenperhaps eight hours to the east the imass is not even aware of us the time for conversation is ended tattersail will you accompany meher mouth dry she said i did not think you one to betray a longstanding friendbellurdan spread his hands wider and said in a pained voice i will never betray you tattersail the high can there be betrayalnot that tattersail replied quickly i once asked if i could speak with you at length remember you said yes bellurdan yet now you tell me conversation is ended i had not imagined your word to be so worthlessin the dying light it was impossible to see the thelomens face but the anguish in his tone was plain i am sorry tattersail you are correct i gave you my word that we would speak again can we not do this while we return to paleno tattersail snapped i wish it nowbellurdan bowed his head very welltattersail forced the tension from her shoulders and neck i have some questions she said first tayschrenn sent you to genabaris for a time didnt he you were searching through some scrolls for himyesmay i ask what were those scrollsis it of vital significance now tattersailit is the truth will help me in deciding whether to go with you or die herebellurdan hesitated only a moment very well among the archives collected from the citys magesall of whom were executed as you knowwere found some copied fragments of gothos folly an ancient jaghut tomei know of it tattersail interjected go onas a thelomen i possess jaghut blood though of course gothos i mage commands both of us how i would deny it the high mage entrusted the examination of these writings to me i was to seek out information concerning the burial of a jaghut tyrant a burial that was in fact a prisonwait tattersail said shaking her head the jaghut had no government what do you mean by a tyrantone whose blood was poisoned by the ambition to rule over others this jaghut tyrant enslaved the land around itall living thingsfor close to three thousand years the imass of the time sought to destroy it and failed it was left to other jaghut to attend to the sundering and imprisoning of the tyrantfor such a creature was as abominable to them as it was to imasstattersails heart now hammered in her chest bellurdan she had to fight to push the words from her where was this tyrant buriedi concluded that the barrow lies south of here in the gadrobi hills directly east of darujhistanoh queen of dreams bellurdan do you know what youve donei have done as i was commanded by our high mageand thats why the tlan imass is with the adjuncti dont understand what you are saying tattersaildammit you brainless ox she rasped they plan to free the tyrant lorns swordher otataral swordno bellurdan rumbled they would not do such a thing rather they seek to prevent someone else releasing it yes that is more likely it is the truth of things now tattersail our conversation is donei cant go back the sorceress said i must go on please dont stop mewe are to return to pale bellurdan said stubbornly your concern has been satisfied permit me to take you back so that i may continue seeking the proper burial place for nightchillthere was no choice left in tattersails mind but there had to be a way out the conversation had bought her time time to recover from the ordeal of travelling by warren bellurdans words returned to her if she accessed her thyr warren now she would be consumed incinerated by the reactive influence of the tlan imass her eyes fell on the burlap sack beside the thelomen and saw from it a faint gleam of sorcery a spellmy own spell she recalled now a gesture of compassion a spell of preservation is this my way out hoods breath is it even possible she thought of hairlock the journey from the dying body to a lifeless vessel shedenul have mercy on usthe sorceress stepped back and opened her warren high thyr magic blazed around her she saw bellurdan stagger back then steady himself he screamed something but she could not hear him then he charged at hershe regretted the thelomens fatal courage as the fire blackened the world around her even as she opened her arms and embraced himlorn strode to tools side the tlan imass faced west and a tension swirled about him that she could almost seewhat is it she asked her eyes on the white fountain of fire rising above the horizon ive never seen anything like thatnor i tool replied it is within the barrier i have cast around usbut thats impossible the adjunct snappedyes impossible to last this long its source should have been consumed almost instantly yet the tlan imass fell silentthere was no need for tool to finish his sentence the pillar of fire still raged in the night sky as it had for the past hour the stars swam in the inky darkness around it magic swirling in a frenzy as if from a bottomless well on the wind was a smell that left lorn slightly nauseous do you recognize the warren tholwarrens adjunct tellann thyr denul uriss tennes thelomen toblakai starvald demelainstarvald denielain what in hoods name is thatelderi thought there were but three elder warrens and thats not one of themthree no there were many adjunct all born of one starvald demelainlorn wrapped her cloak tighter about herself eyes on the column of fire who could manage such a conjuringthere was one once of worshippers there are none left so he is no more i have no answer to your question adjunct the imass staggered as the pillar bloomed outwards then winked out a distant thundering rumble reached themgone lorn whispereddestroyed tool said the warrior cocked his head strange the source is indeed destroyed but something has also been born i sense it a new presencelorn checked her sword what is it she demandedtool shrugged new it fleeswas this cause for worry lorn scowled and turned to the tlan imass but he had already left her side and was now striding back to their campfire the adjunct glanced once more at the western horizon there was a cloud blotting out the stars it looked huge she shiveredit was time to sleep the imass would stand guard so she need not worry about surprise visitors the day had been long and shed overrationed her water she felt weak an unfamiliar sensation her scowl deepened as she walked to the camp tool standing immobile beside the flames reminded her of his arrival two days ago the fiery glimmer that jumped along his withered fleshandbone helm once again triggered something primordial in her mind and with it came a deep unreasoning fear of darkness she stepped close to the imass fire is life she whispered the phrase seeming to rise from the depths of instincttool nodded life is fire he said with such words was born the first empire the empire of imass the empire of humanity the warrior turned to the adjunct youve done well my childthe grey pall of smoke hung unmoving over blackdog forest a dozen leagues north of her as crone dipped her splayed tail and sank wearily towards the army encamped on the rhivi plainthe tents marched outward like spokes from a central fortified hub where stood a large canopy rippling in the morning breeze towards this centre the great raven descended her sharp gaze marked rhivi plainsmen moving among the aisles off on the eastern rim fluttered the banners of the catlin horse green and silver to mark the mercenary contingent of caladan broods main army by far the greatest proportion of soldiers however were tiste and anomander rakes people dwellers of the city within moons spawntheir tall darkclad forms moving like shadows between the tentswheeled tracks led north to the forest fringes supply routes to entrenchments once held by the malazans and now marking broods front lines rhividriven carts moved forward an endless stream of supplies while other wagons laden with the dead and the wounded entered the camp in a grim flowcrone cackled magic bled from the main tent and stained the dusty air with a heavy turgid magenta the colour of the uriss warren earth magic her wings now felt light and held a youthful spring as she beat the air ahhh crone sighed magic sweeping through the wards and traps the great raven glided over the tent and thrummed rapidly as she dropped outside the entranceno guard barred the doorway which had been left pulled back and tied to a support pole crone hopped insidewith the exception of a small hanging at the far end behind which squatted an army cot no other divisions had been made within the tentin the centre stood a massive table its surface etched with the contours of the surrounding land one man stood alone leaning over it his back to the doorway an enormous iron hammer was slung across his broad back despite its size and evident weight it looked almost toylike against that span of muscle and bone power rolled from him in musky wavesdelays delays crone muttered as she flapped up to land on the tabletopcaladan brood grunted distractedlyyou sensed the storm of sorcery last night she askedsensed we could see it the rhivi shamans seem somewhat disturbed but they have no answers well discuss that later crone now i must thinkcrone cocked her head at the map the west flank falls back in total disarray who commands that barghast mobbrood asked when did you fly within

ofyet you show little concern warrior why is that crone wondersi have been in communication with prince kazz and his mages and with the barghast and rhivi shamans what was born on the plain last night

midst of it crone purred plotting and counterplotting scattering broken glass in everyones path ive never seen him in a better moodenough gossip you have news for meof course master crone stretched her wings and sighed she jabbed her beak at an itch crunched a flea and gulped it down i know who holds the spinning coinwhoa youth whose bliss is ignorance the coin spins and turns a face to all those in his company theyve their own game but it will converge with greater things and so oponns thin threads reverberate in spheres otherwise immune to the jesters influencewhat does rake knowof this little but you well know his dislike of oponn he would cut those threads given the opportunityidiot brood muttered he thought for a time unmoving like a shaping of stone and iron while crone ambled back and forth across the rhivi plain her long black talons scattering the wooden regiment and division markers like dominoeswithout oponn rakes power is presently unmatched brood said he hangs over darujhistan like a beacon and the empress is sure to send something against him such a battle wouldlevel darujhistan crone chirped brightly in flames numbering twelve so fly the free cities so much ash in the windrakes disdain for everything beneath him has left us stumbling and flat on our faces one time too many brood said he glanced at crone and raised a hairless eyebrow youre scattering my armies stop itcrone stopped pacing and squatted once again she sighed caladan brood the great warrior seeks the bloodless way rake gets that coin and hell pull oponn right in and spit the lord and lady on that lovely sword of his imagine the chaos that would ensuea wonderful ripple that could topple gods and deluge realms she heard her own excitement and revelled in its blatancy such funquiet bird brood said the coin bearer needs protection now that rakes recalled his magesbut who is there to match the tiste and crone asked surely you dont intend to leave your campaign herebrood bared his

unmoving for close to twenty minutes then he straightened stepping outside he searched the sky crone was nowhere in sight he grunted and turned to survey the nearest tents kallor where are youa tall

away kallor sighed rake again is it warlord youd do better to follow my advice and destroy him you will dismissing my advice brood his dull eyes followed brood until he turned a corner and disappeared from sight consider that my last warningthe charred earth crunched under their horses hoofs the glance that toc the younger threw back over his shoulder was received with a grim nod from captain paran they were nearing the source of last nights column of fireas toc had promised leaving the city had proved a simple matter none accosted them and the gates had been left ajar their horses were indeed wickanbred lean and longlimbed and though their ears flattened and eyes rolled they held to the discipline of their reinsthe still midday air was heavy with the stench of sulphur and already a fine coat of ash covered the two riders and their horses overhead the sun was a bright copper orb toc stopped his mount and waited for the captain to arriveparan wiped grimy sweat from his brow and adjusted his helmetcamail felt heavy on his shoulders as he squinted ahead they were heading towards the place where the pillar of fire had come from the night just past had been one of deep fear for paran neither he nor toc had ever witnessed such a conflagration of sorcery though they had camped leagues away they had felt the heat pouring from it now as they approached all paran could feel was dreadneither he nor toc spoke perhaps a hundred yards eastward r something that looked like a misshapen tree stump one gnarled blackened branch reaching skyward in a perfect circle around it the grass sward was untouched for perhaps five yards a dark smudge lay in the unburned area slightly off to one sideparan nudged his mount forward and toc followed after unslinging and stringing his bow as toc caught up with the captain paran saw that his companion had nocked an arrowthe closer they approached the less like a tree the charred thing looked the limb that reached out from it had familiar lines parans gaze narrowed some more then he cursed and spurred his horse he closed the distance quickly leaving behind a startled tocarriving he dismounted and strode up to what he now saw were two bodies one gigantic both had been burned beyond recognition but paran held no illusions as to who the other was all that come close to me all that i care for tattersail he whispered then fell to his kneestoc joined him but remained in the saddle standing in the stirrups and scanning the horizon a minute later he dismounted and walked a slow circle around the embracing bodies stopping at the dark smudge theyd seen from a distance he crouched to study itparan raised his head and struggled to keep his eyes on the figures the limb belonged to the giant the fire that had consumed them both had blackened the arm for most of its length but its hand was only slightly scorched paran stared at the grasping fingers and wondered what salvation the giant had reached for in its moment of death the freedom that is death a freedom denied me damn the gods damn them allnumbed he was slow to realize that toc called to himit was an effort to rise to his feet he staggered to where toc still crouched on the ground before the man was a torn burlap sacktracks lead from this toc said shakily a strange expression on his face he scratched vigorously at his scar then rose heading northeastparan looked at his companion without comprehension trackssmall like a childs only only what the man hugged himself those feet were mostly bones he met the captains blank stare as if the soles were gone rotted or burned awayi dont know something horrible has happened here captain im glad its heading away whatever it isparan turned back to the two entwined figures he flinched one hand reached up to touch his face thats tattersail he said in a flat voicei know im sorry the other one is the thelomen high mage bellurdan it has to be toc looked down at the burlap sack he took leave to come out here and bury nightchill he added quietly i dont think nightchill needs burying any moretayschrenn did this paran saidsomething in the captains voice brought toc roundtayschrenn and the adjunct tattersail was right they would not have killed her otherwise only she didnt die easily she never took the easy path in anythinglorns taken her from me just like shes tak everything elsecaptainparans hand unconsciously gripped the pommel of his sword the heartless bitch has a lot coming to her and i mean to deliver itfine toc growled just lets be smart about itparan glared at him lets get going toc the youngertoc glanced one last time into the northeast this wasnt over he said to himself shivering he winced as a savage painful itch rose beneath scar though he tried he found he could not reach through to it and formless fire burned behind his empty eyesocketsomething he had been experiencing often lately muttering he strode to his horse a climbed into the saddlethe captain had already swung his own mount and the trailing horse southward the set of the mans back spoke volumes to toc the younger and he wondered if he hadnt made a mistake in accompanying him then he shrugged well he said to the two charred bodies as he rode past its done aint itthe plain below lay sheathed in darkness looking to the west crone could still see the setting sun she rode the highest winds the air around her bitter cold the great raven had left caladan broods company days ago since then shed detected no sign of life in the wastes below even the massive herds of bhederin which the rhivi were in the habit following had disappearedat night crones senses were limited though it was in such darkness that she could best detect sorcery as she winged ever southward she scanned the land far below with a hungry eye others among her brethren from moons spawn regularly patrolled the plains in service anomander rake shed yet to see one but it was only a matter of time when she did she would ask them if theyd detected any source of magic recentlybrood was not one to overreact if something was happening down here that soured his palate it could be momentous and she wanted know of it before anyone elsefire flashed in the sky ahead of her perhaps a league distant it flared briefly tinged green and blue then disappeared crone tensed that had been sorcery but of a kind shed never known as she swept into the air the air washed over her hot and wet with a charnel stench that remind her ofshe cocked her headburnt feathersa cry sounded ahead angry and frightened crone opened her beak reply then shut it again it had come from one of her kin she certain but for some reason she felt the need to hold her tongue then another ball of fire flashed this time close enough to crone that she saw what it engulfed a great ravenher breath hissed from her beak in that brief instant of light shed seen half a dozen more of her brethren wheeling in the sky ahead of her and to the west she thrummed her wings and angled towards themwhen she could hear their panicked flapping about her on all sides crone called out children attend to crone the great mother has come the ravens voiced relieved cries and closed in around her they all shrieked at once in an effort to tell her what was happening but crones angry hiss silenced them at once i heard among you hurtles voice crone said did i not one male swept near her you did he replied i am hurtleive just come from the north hurtle explain to me what has occurredconfusion hurtle drawled sarcasticallycrone cackled she loved a good joke more than anyone indeed go on ladbefore dusk kin clip detected a flare of sorcery below her on the plain it was odd its feel but clearly a warren had just opened and something had issued on to the plain kin clip spoke to me of this then investigated i shadowed her from above during the descent and so saw what she saw crone it has come to my mind that once again the art of soulshifting has been exercisedehr travelling on the ground and having just come from a warren was a small puppet hurtle explained animate and possessing great power when this puppet detected clip he gestured at her and she burst into flames since then the creature has disappeared into its warren reappearing only to kill another of uswhy do you remain crone demandedhurtle chuckled we would determine its course crone thus far it seems to travel southwardvery well now that thats been confirmed leave and take the others with you return to moons spawn and report to our lordas you command crone hurtle dipped a wing and slid off into darkness his voice called out and was answered by a choruscrone waited she wanted to be certain that they had all departed the area before doing some investigating on her own was this puppet the thing birthed in the pillar of fire it didnt seem likely and what kind of sorcery did it employ that no great raven could absorbthere was an eldering taste about this soulshifting was no simple cantrip and it had never been commonustsuig the wizards even when its techniques were known too many tales of madness born within the shiftingperhaps this puppet had survived from cese times crone thought about that unlikelymagic bloomed on the plain below then faded a small magical form scampered from the spot weaving as it ran here thought crone lie the answers to my questions destroy my younglings will you would you so easily disdain croneshe crooked her wings and dropped the air whistled around her she raised a penumbra of protective magic that encapsulated her just as the small figure ceased its march and looked up faintly crone heard a manic laugh rise up to meet her then the puppet gesturedthe power that engulfed crone was iowricse far beyond anything she anticipated her defences held but she found herself buffeted as if fists punched her from every direction she cried out in pain spinning as she fell it took all her strength and will to mm out her battered wings and catch a rising current of air she voiced an outraged alarmed shriek she climbed higher into the night sky a tffice down revealed that the puppet had returned once again to its warren for nothing magical was visibleaye she sighed what a price to pay for knowledge elder warrren indeed the eldest of them all who plays with chaos crone knows naught all things are gathering l here she found another stream of wind and angled south this was something anomander rake must know of never mind caladan the  instructions that the ti and lord be kept ignorant of almost iampthing rake was good more than brood credited him vmmm met for one crone laugh and death good at deathshe picked up speed so did not notice the dead smudge on the plain below her nor the woman camped in its centre there was no me there to speak of in any caseadjunct lorn squatted by her bedroll her eyes scanning the night sky tool was all that connected to what we witnessed two nights agothe tlan imass shook his head i think  srot adjunct if anything concerns me more it is sorcery and it wres the barrier i have around ushow she asked quietlythere is only one possibility adjunct it is eldering a lost warren ages past returned to us whoever its

portal directly behind us once we are foundive no fear of magic lorn muttered let me sleepthe tlan imass fell silent but he continued staring down at the woman as the hours of night crawled on tool moved slightly as dawn lightened the east then was still againgroaning lorn rolled on to her back as the sunlight reached her faceshe opened her eyes and blinked rapidly then froze she slowly raised her head to find the tlan imass standing directly above herand hovering inches from her throat was the tip of the warriors flint swordsuccess tool said demands discipline adjunct last night we witnessed an expression of elder magic choosing as its target ravens ravens adjunct do not fly at night you might think the combination of my abilities with yours ensures our safety that is no guarantee adjunct the tlan imass withdrew his weapon and stepped to one sidelorn drew a shaky breath a flaw she said pausing to clear her throat before continuing which i admit to tool thank you for alerting me to my growing complacency she sat up tell me doesnt it strike you as odd that this supposedly empty rhivi plain should display so much activityconvergence tool said power ever draws other power it is not a complicated thought yet it escaped us the imass the ancient warrior swung his head to the adjunct as it escapes their children the jaghut well understood the danger thus they avoided one another abandoned each other to solitude and left a civilization to crumble into dust the forkrul assail understood as well though they chose another path what is odd adjunct is that of these three founding peoples it is the imass whose legacy of ignorance survived the ageslorn stared at tool was that an attempt at humour she askedthe tlan imass adjusted his helmet that depends on your mood adjunctshe climbed to her feet and strode to check her horses youre getting stranger every day tool she said quietly more to herself than to the imass into her mind returned the first thing she had seen when she opened her eyesthat damned creature and his sword how long had he stood like that all nightthe adjunct paused to test her shoulder tentatively it was healing quickly perhaps the injury had not been as severe as shed first thought as she saddled her horse she chanced to glance at tool the warrior stood staring at her what kind of thoughts would occupy someone whod lived through three hundred thousand years or did the imas live before meeting tool she had generally thought of them as undead hence without a soul the flesh alone animated by some external forcebut now she wasnt so suretell me tool what dominates your thoughtsthe imass shrugged before replying i think of futility adjunctdo all imass think about futilityno few think at allwhy is thatthe imass leaned his head to one side and regarded her because adjunct it is futilelets get going tool were wasting timeyes adjunctshe climbed into the saddle wondering how the imass had meant thatbook four assassinsi dreamed a coin with shifting faceso many youthful visages so many costly dreams and it rolled and rang round the gilded rim of a chalice made for gemslife of dreams mares the hagchapter eleventhe night held close as i wandered my spirit unfooted to either earth or stone unravelled from tree undriven by iron nail but like the night itself a thing of air stripped of light so i came upon them those masons who cut and carved stone in the night sighting by stars and battered handwhat of the sun asked i of them is not its cloak of revelation the warmth of reason in your shapingand one among them answered no soul can withstand the suns bones of light and reason dims when darkness fallsso we shape barrows in the night for you and your kinforgive my interruption then said ithe dead never interrupt said the mason they but arrivepaupers stone darujhistan ofyet another night yet another dream kruppe moaned with naught but a scant fire to keep this wanderer company he held his hands over the flickering undying hearth that had been stoked by an elder god it seemed an odd gift but he sensed a significance to it kruppe would understand this meaning for rare and unwelcome is this frustrationthe landscape around him was barren even the ploughed earth was gone with no sign of habitation in sight he squatted by the lone fire in a tundra wasteland and the air had the breath of rotting ice to the north and to the east the horizon gleamed green almost luminescent though no moon had risen to challenge the stars kruppe had never before seen such a thing yet it was an image fashioned within his minddisturbing indeed proclaims kruppe are these visions of instinct then unfurled in this dream for a purpose kruppe knows not and would return to his warm bed this instant were the choice hishe stared about at the lichen and mosscovered ground frowning at the strange bright colours born there hed heard tales of redspire plain that land far to the north beyond the laederon plateau is this what tundra looked like hed always pictured a bleak colourless world yet peruse these stars overhead they glisten with a youthful energy nay sparkle as if amused by the one who contemplates them while the earth itself hints of vast blushes of red orange and lavenderkruppe rose as low thunder reached him from the west in the distance moved a massive herd of brownfurred beasts the steam of their breath gusted silver in the air above and behind them as they ran turning as one this way and that but ever at a distance he watched them for some timewhen they came closest to him he saw the reddish streaks in their fur and their horns sweeping down then up and out the land shook with their passagesuch is the life in this world kruppe wonders has he travelled back then to the very beginning of thingsyou have said a deep voice behind himkruppe turned ah come to share my fire of course he saw before him a squat figure covered in the tanned hides of deer or some such similar animal antlers stretched out from a flat skullcap on the mans head grey and covered in fuzzy skin kruppe bowed you see before you kruppe of darujhistani am pran chole of cannig tols clan among the kron tlan pran stepped close and crouched before the fire i am also the white fox kruppe wise in the ways of ice he glanced at kruppe and smiledprans face was wide the bones pronounced beneath smooth gold skin his eyes were barely visible between tight lids but what kruppe saw of them was a startling amber in colour pran reached out long supple hands over the fire fire is life and life is fire the age of ice passes kruppe long have we lived here hunting the great herds gathering to war with the jaghut in the southlands birthing and dying with the ebb and flow of the frozen riverskruppe has travelled far thento the beginning and to the end my kind give way to your kind kruppe though the wars do not cease what we shall give to you is freedom from such wars the jaghut dwindle ever retreat into forbidding places the forkrul assail have vanished though we never found need to fight them and the kchain chemalle are no morethe ice spoke to them with words of death prans gaze swung back to the fire our hunting has brought death to the great herds kruppe we are driven south and this must not be we are the tlan but soon the gathering comes and so shall be voiced the rite of imass and the choosing of the bone casters and then shall come the sundering of flesh of time itselfwith the gathering shall be born the tlan imass and the first empirewhy kruppe wonders is he herepran chole shrugged i have come for i have been called by whom i know not perhaps it is the same with youbut kruppe is dreaming this is kruppes dreamthen i am honoured pran straightened one of your time comes perhaps this one possesses the answers we seekkruppe followed prans gaze to the south he raised an eyebrow if not mistaken then kruppe recognizes her as a rhivithe woman who approached was perhaps middleaged heavy with child her dark round face bore features similar to pran choles though less pronounced fear shone in her eyes yet there was a grim determination about her as well she reached the fire and eyed the two men most of her attention drawing to pran chole tlan she said the tellann warren of the imass of our time has birthed a child in a confluence of sorceries its soul wanders lost its flesh is an abomination a shifting must take place she turned to kruppe and swept back the thick woven robe she wore revealing her swelled stomach the bare stretched skin had been recently traced in a tattoo the image was that of a whitehaired fox the elder god walks again risen from blood spilled on consecrated stone krul came in answer to the childs need and now aids us in our quest he apologizes to you kruppe for using the world within your dream but no younger god can influence this place somehow you have made your soul immune to themthe rewards of cynicism kruppe said bowingthe woman smiledi understand pran chole said you would make of this child born of imass powers a soletakenyes it is the best we can manage tlan a shapeshifterwhich we too know as soletakenmust be fashionedkruppe cleared his throat excuse kruppe please but are we not missing someone vital to these plansshe strides two worlds the rhivi said vrul guides her now into yours she is frightened still it falls to you kruppe to welcome herkruppe adjusted the sleeves of his faded threadbare cloak this should not prove difficult for one of kruppes charmsperhaps the rhivi said frowning her flesh is an abomination you have been warnedkruppe nodded affably then looked around will any direction dopran chole laughedi suggest south the rhivi saidhe shrugged and with a bow to the two companions he headed south after a few minutes he glanced back but the fire was nowhere in sight he was alone in the chill nighta full moon appeared on the eastern horizon bathing the land in silver light ahead the tundra rolled on as far as kruppe could see flat and featureless then he squinted something had just appeared still distant walking with seeming great difficulty he watched it fall once then climb back to its feet despite the luminescence the figure looked blackkruppe moved forward it had yet to see him and he stopped when he was but thirty feet away the rhivi had been right kruppe produced his silk handkerchief and wiped the sweat that had sprung across his browthe figure had been a woman once tall with long black hair but that woman had been long dead her flesh had withered and assumed the hue of dark wood perhaps the most horrific aspect of her was her limbs which had been roughly sewn back on to her body aye kruppe whispered this woman had been torn apart oncethe womans head flew up and sightless eyes fixed upon kruppe she stopped her mouth opening but no words coming forthsurreptitiously kruppe cast a spell upon himself then looked at her yet again he frowned a spell had been woven about the woman one of preservation but something had happened to that spell something had reshaped it lass kruppe barked i know you can hear me he didnt know but decided to insist in any case your soul is trapped within a body that is not your own it does not become you i am named kruppe and i will lead you to succour come he spun round and began to walk a moment later he heard a shuffling behind him and smiled ah he whispered kruppe has charms indeed but more he can be harsh when necessarythe fire had returned a beacon e retern and kruppe qaxxrta ft three figures awaiting them the vestiges of the spell he had cast upon himsell made the tlan and the rhivi blinding to his eyes such was their powerpran chole stepped forward thank you kruppe he studied the woman and nodded slowly yes i see the effects of the imass upon herbut there is more he looked to the rhivi she was a mage oncethe rhivi moved close to the woman hear me lost one your name tattersail your sorcery is thyr the warren flows within you now it animates you protects you she opened her robe once more it is time to bring you back into the worldtattersail stepped back in alarm within you is the past pran said my world you know the present and the rhivi offers you to the future in this place all is merged the flesh you wear has upon it a spell of preservation and in your dying act you opened your warren within the influence of tellarm and now you wander within a mortals dream kruppe is the vessel of change permit i with a wordless cry tattersail staggered into prans arms the rhivimy kruppe breathed but kruppes dreams have taken a strange turn while his own concerns are ever present a haunting voice once kruppe looked up at the elder god kruppe asks for nothing there is a gift in this and i am glad to be part of its makingkrul nodded nevertheless speak to me of your effortsrallick and murillio seek to right an old wrong kruppe said with sigh they think me ignorant of their schemes but i shall turn such schemes to my purposes guilt rides this decision but they are neededprotection has been set in motion though its final shaping i come i know that the malazan empire acts covertly for the moment what they seekyet tc is anything but clear kruppe even to them use this to your advantage when you find them allies might come from surprising quarters i will tell you this two now approach the city one is a tlan imass the other a bane to magic their purposes are destructive but already forces are in play attending to them seek knowledge of them but do no openly oppose them they are dangerous power attracts power kruppe leave them to the consequences of their actionskruppe nodded kruppe is no fool krul he openly opposes no one and he finds power a thing to be avoided at all costsas they spoke the rhivi woman had taken tattersail in her arms pran chole squatted nearby his eyes closed and his lips forming silent wordsthe rhivi woman rocked the desiccated body in rhythmic motion chanting softly water stained the rhivis thighsaye kruppe whispered she prepares to give birth in truthabruptly the rhivi tossed away the body it crumpled in a lifeless heapthe moon now hung immediately overhead so bright that kruppe found he could not look at it directlythe rhivi had assumed a squatting position moving with the rhythm of labour her face sheathed in sweat pran chole remained immobile though his body was racked in shivering bouts that twisted his face with pain his eyes opened wide glowing bright amber and fixed on the moonelder god kruppe said quietly how much will this tattersail remember of her former lifeunknown krul replied soulshifting is a delicate thing the woman was consumed in a conflagration her souls first flight was carried on wings of pain and violence more she entered another ravaged body bearing its own traumas the child that is born will be like no other ever seen its life is a mystery kruppekruppe grunted considering her parents she will indeed be exceptional a thought came to him and he frowned vrul what of the first child within the rhivithere was none kruppe the rhivi woman was prepared in a manner unknown to any man he chuckled including myself he raised his head this sorcery belongs to the moon kruppethey continued watching the labours of birth to kruppe it seemed they waited more hours in the darkness than any normal night could hold the moon remained overhead as if it found its position to its likingor he reconsidered as if it stood guard over themthen a small cry rose into the still air and the rhivi lifted in her arms a child furred in silvereven as kruppe watched the fur sloughed away the rhivi turned the child and placed her mouth against its belly her jaws bunched and the remaining length of umbilical cord fell awaypran chole strode to stand beside kruppe and the elder god the tlan looked exhausted the child drew from me power beyond my control he said softlyas the rhivi squatted again in afterbirth holding the child against her chest kruppes eyes widened the mothers belly was smooth the white fox tattoo was gonei am saddened pran said that i may not return in twenty years to see the woman this child shall becomeyou shall krul said in a low tone but not as a tlan as a tlan imass bone casterthe breath hissed between prans teeth how long he askedthree hundred thousand years pran chole of cannig tols clankruppe laid a hand on prans arm youve something to look forward to he saidthe tlan stared at kruppe a moment then he threw back his head and roared with laughterthe hours before kruppes dream had proved eventful beginning with his meeting with baruk that permitted the revelation of the coin bearer punctuated with the clever if slightly dramatic suspension of the coins wax impressiona cantrip that had gone strangely awrybut soon after the meeting droplets of nowhardened wax pebbling the breast and arms of his coat kruppe paused just outside the alchemists door roald was nowhere to be seen oh my kruppe breathed as he wiped sweat from his forehead why should master baruk find crokuss name familiar ah stupid kruppe uncle mammot of course oh dear that was closeall could well have been lost he continued on down the hall to the stairsfor a time there oponns power had waxed considerably kruppe smiled at his pun but it was a distracted smile he would do well to avoid such contacts power had a habit of triggering his own talents already he felt the urgings of the deck of dragons within his headhe hurried down the stairs and crossed the main hall to the doorsroald was just entering burdened beneath mundane supplies kruppe noted the dust covering the old mans clothing dear roald you look as if youve just weathered a sandstorm do you require kruppes assistanceno roald grunted thank you kruppe i can manage will you be so kind as to close the doors on your way outof course kind roald kruppe patted the mans arm and strode out into the courtyard the gates leading to the street had been left open and beyond was a swirling cloud of dust ah yes the road repairs kruppe muttereda headache had burgeoned behind his eyes and the bright sun overhead wasnt helping matters any he was halfway to the gates when he stopped the doors kruppe has forgotten to close the doors he spun round and returned to the estate entrance sighing as the doors closed with a satisfying click as he turned away a second time someone shouted in the street beyond there followed a loud crash but this latter sound was lost on kruppewith that bellowed curse a sorcerous storm roared into his head he fell to his knees then his head snapped up eyes widening that he whispered was indeed a malazan curse then why does house shadows image burn like fire in kruppes skull who now walks the streets of darujhistan a count of knots unending mysteries solved more mysteries createdthe pain had passed kruppe climbed to his feet and brushed the dust from his clothing good that said affliction occurred beyond the eyes of suspicious beings kruppe notes with relief all upon a promise made to friend roald wise old friend roald oponns breath is this time welcome though begrudgingly sohe strode to the gates and peered into the street a cart filled with shattered cobbles had toppled two men argued incessantly as to whose fault it was while they righted the cart and proceeded to refill itkruppe studied them they spoke well the daru tongue but to one who listened carefully there was the hint of an accentan accent that did not belong oh my kruppe said stepping back he adjusted his coat took a deep breath then opened the gate and walked into the streetthe fat little man with the flopping sleeves walked from the houses gate and turned left he seemed in a hurrysergeant whiskeyjack wiped the sweat from his brow with a scarred forearm his eyes slits against the bright sunlightthat is the one sergeant sorry said beside himare you sureyes im surewhiskeyjack watched the man winding through the crowd whats so important about him he askedi admit sorry replied to some uncertainty as to his significance but he is vital sergeantwhiskeyjack chewed his lip then turned to the wagon bed where a city map had been laid flat its corners anchored down by chunks of rock who lives in that estatea man named baruk sorry answered an alchemisthe scowled how did she know that are you saying that fat little man is this barukno he works for the alchemist not a servant a spy perhaps his skills involve thievery and he possesses talentwhiskeyjack looked up a seerfor some reason sorry winced the sergeant watched bemused as sorrys face paled damn he wondered what on earth is going on with this girli believe so she said her voice tremblingwhiskeyjack straightened all right follow himshe nodded shakily then slipped into the crowdthe sergeant rested his back against the wagons sidewall his expression soured as he studied his squad trotts was swinging his pick as if on a battlefield stones flew everywhere passersby ducked and cursed when ducking failed hedge and fiddler crouched behind a wheelbarrow flinching each time the barghasts pick struck the street mallet stood a short distance away directing pedestrians to the other pavementhe no longer bellowed at the people having lost his voice arguing with an old man with a donkey wobbling under an enormous basket of firewood the bundles now lay scattered across the streetthe old man and the donkey nowhere to be seenproviding an effective barrier to wheeled vehiclesall in all whiskeyjack concluded everyone with him had assumed the role of heatcrazed street worker with a facility he found oddly disturbinghedge and fiddler had acquired the wagon loaded down with cobbles less than an hour after their midnight landing at a public dock on the lakefront exactly how this had been accomplished whiskeyjack was afraid to ask but it suited their plans perfectly something nagged at the back of whiskeyjacks mind but he dismissed it he was a soldier and a soldier followed orders when the time came there would be chaos at every major intersection of streets in the cityplanting mines aint gonna be easy fiddler had pointed out so we do it right in front of everyones nose road repairwhiskeyjack shook his head true to fiddlers prediction no one had yet questioned them they continued ripping up streets and replacing the old cobbles with moranth munitions encased in firehardened clay was everything going to be so easyhis thoughts returned to sorry not likely quick ben and kalam had at last convinced him that their half of the mission was better off without her shed tagged along with his crew eyes never still but otherwise offering little in the way of assistance he admitted to feeling some relief that hed sent her off on that fat mans trailbut what had pulled a seventeenyearold girl into the world of warhe couldnt understand ithe couldnt get past her youthfulness couldnt see beyond to the cold murderous killer behind those dead eyesas much as he told his squad that she was as human as any of them the doubts grew with every question about her that he could not answer he knew almost nothing about her the revelation that she could manage a fishing boat had come from seemingly nowhere and here in darujhistan shed hardly acted like a girl raised in a fishing village there was a natural poise about her a measure of assurance more common to the higher educated classes no matter where she was she carried herself as if she belonged theredid that sound like a seventeenyearold girl no but it seemed to match quick bens assertions and that galled him how else to match her with that icycold woman torturing prisoners outside nathilog he could look at her and part of him would say young not displeasing to the eye a confidence that makes her magneticwhile another part of his mind snapped shut young hed hear his own harsh pained laugh oh no not this lass shes old she walked under a bloodred moon in the dawn of time did this one her face is the face of all that cannot be fathomed and shes looking you in the eye whiskeyjack and youll never know what shes thinkinghe could feel sweat drain down his face and neck nonsense that part of his mind lost itself to its own terror it took the unknown and fashioned in blind desperation a visage it could recognize despair he told himself always demands a direction a focus find the direction and the despair goes awayof course it wasnt that easy the despair he felt had no shape it was not just sorry not just this endless war not even the treachery from within the empire he had nowhere to look for answers and he was tired of asking questionswhen he had looked upon sorry at greydog the source of his horror lay in the unveiling of what he was becoming a killer stripped of remorse armoured in the cold iron of inhumanity freed from the necessity to ask questions to seek answers to fashion a reasonable life like an island in a sea of slaughterin the empty eyes of this child hed seen the withering of his own soulthe reflection had been unblemished with no imperfections to challenge the truth of what he sawthe sweat running down his back beneath the jerkin felt hot against the chill that gripped him whiskeyjack lifted a trembling hand to his forehead in the days and nights ahead people would die by his command hed been thinking of that as the fruition of his careful precise planningsuccess measured by the ratio of the enemys dead to his own losses the cityits busy jostling multitudes unceasing in their lives small and large cowardly and braveno more than a gameboard and the game played solely for the benefit of others hed made his plans  it nqdms qf himself was at stake and yet his friends might diethere hed finally called them what they wereand the friends of others might die and sons daughters parents the rollcall of shattered lives seemed unendingwhiskeyjack pressed his back against the sidewall in an effort to steady his reeling mind desperately he lifted his gaze from the street he saw a man at a window on the second floor of the estate the man was watching them and his hands were bright redshaken the sergeant looked away he bit into the side of his mouth until he felt a sharp stab of pain then tasted blood concentrate he told himself step back from that chasm concentrate or youll die and not just you but also your squad they trust you to get them out of thisyouve got to keep earning that trust he drew a deep breath through his nostrils then turned to one side and spat a mouthful of blood he stared down at the redslicked cobble there he hissed its easy to look at it isnt ithe heard footsteps and looked up to see hedge and fiddler arriveboth men wore troubled expressionsyou all right sarge fiddler asked quietly behind the two saboteurs mallet approached his gaze calculating and fixed on whiskeyjacks white sweatsoaked facethe sergeant grimaced were behind schedule how much longertheir faces smeared with white dust and sweat the two men looked at each other then hedge answered three hourswe decided on seven mines fiddler said four sparkers two flamers and one cusserwill that bring down some of these buildings whiskeyjack asked avoiding mallets eyessure no better way to block an intersection fiddler grinned at his companionyou got one in particular you want dropped hedge inquiredthe estate behind you is an alchemistsright hedge said that should light the sky all rightyouve got two and a half hours whiskeyjack said then its on to the majesty hill crossroadsmallet stepped close another headache he asked softlywhiskeyjack closed his eyes then gave a sharp nodthe healer raised a hand and passed it over the sergeants brow just easing it a little he saidthe sergeant grinned ruefully this is getting old mallet youre even using the same words a cool numbness flowed through his thoughtsmallets face was drawn he lowered his hand when we have time ill find the source whiskeyjackright the sergeant smiled when we have timehope kal and quick are doing ok mallet said turning to watch the street traffic you sent sorry offyes were on our own they know where to find us all three of them he glanced up at the estate window the man with the red hands was still there though now he was studying the distant rooftops a cloud of dust rose between them and whiskeyjack returned his attention to the city map where every major intersection the barracks and majesty hill had been circled in red malletsargebit the inside of my cheek againthe heater stepped close once more raising his handcrokus younghand strode south on trallits walk the first signs of the upcoming gedderone fte had appeared dyed banners hung from clotheslines over the street painted flowers and strips of bark framed doorways and bushels of dried weeds had been tacked to walls at every crossingoutlanders already filled the streets gadrobi herders rhivi traders catlin weaversa mob of sweaty shouting excited people animal smells mixed with human making the narrower alleys so redolent as to be almost impassable which in turn crowded the main thoroughfare even morein past years crokus had revelled in the celebration pushing through the midnight crowds and filling his own pockets by emptying those around him during the fte worries of the malazan empires exploits in the far north disappeared for a time his uncle always smiled at that saying the turn of the season gave the efforts of humanity their proper perspective the mewling petty acts hed say of a shortlived ar shortsighted species crokus can do nothing to mar the great cycles of lifeas he walked home mammots words returned to him now he had always looked upon his uncle as a wise if slightly ineffectual old man increasingly however he found himself troubled by mammots observationscelebrating gedderones rite of spring shouldnt be an excuse to avoid the pressures of reality it wasnt just a harmless escape it was a means of delaying the probable and making it inevitable we could dance in the streets all year long he scowled to himself to a thousand great cycles and with the same certainty reserved for the coming and going of seasons the malazan empire would march through our gates theyd end the dance with the edge of a sword being industrious disciplined people impatient with useless expenditures of energygrimly shortsightedhe came to a tenement and nodding at the pipesmoking old woman sitting on the steps went inside the hallway was empty the usual crowd of children no doubt outside playing in the streets and a calming domestic murmur drifted out from behind closed doors he climbed the creaking staircase to the first flooroutside mammots door the scholars pet winged monkey hovered scratching and pulling desperately at the latch it ignored crokus until he arrived to push it aside then it squealed and flew in circles around his headbeing a pain again eh crokus said to the creature waving a hand as it flew too close and ended up snarled in his hair tiny humanlike hands gripped his scalp all right moby he said relenting and opened the doorinside mammot was preparing herbal tea without turning he asked tea crokus and as for that little monster whos probably riding your head tell him ive had just about enough of him todaymoby sniffed indignantly and flapped over to the scholars desk where he landed with a bellyflop scattering papers to the floor he chirpedsighing mammot turned with the tray in his hands his watery eyes fixed on crokus you look tired ladcrokus slumped into the less ragged of the two chairs occupying the room yes tired and in a dark moodmy tea will do its usual wonders mammot said smilingcrokus grunted not looking up maybe maybe notmammot stepped forward and laid the tray on a small table between the chairs he sat down with a soft groan as you know i possess few moral qualms about your chosen profession crokus since i question rights of any kind including ownership even privileges demand responsibility as ive always said and the privilege of ownership demands that the owner be responsible for protecting his or her claim my only concern of course is for risks you must perforce takemammot leaned forward and poured tea lad a thief must be sure of one thinghis concentration distractions are dangerouscrokus glanced up at his uncle what have you been writing all these years he asked suddenly gesturing at the desksurprised mammot picked up his cup and sat back well a genuine interest in education then finally as ive said before crokus you possess the intelligence to go so far and while im but a humble man of letters my word will open to you many doors in the city indeed even the city council is not beyond your reach if you would choose such a direction discipline lad the very same requirement youve mastered as a thiefa crafty expression glittered in crokuss gaze as it held on mammothow long would it take he asked quietly to become known in such circleswell said mammot it is the learning that matters of courseof course in crokuss mind however there rose the image of a sleeping maidenmammot blew on his drink with fulltime studies and your youthful eagerness i would hazard a year perhaps more perhaps less is there a need for hastejust youthful eagerness i suppose in any case you havent answered me yet what are you writing uncleah mammot glanced at his desk raising an eyebrow at moby who had opened an inkwell and was drinking from it the history of darujhistan he said i am just beginning the fifth volume which opens with the reign of ektalm second to last of the tyrant kingscrokus blinked whosmiling marnmot sipped his tea usurper of letastte and succeeded by his daughter sandenay who brought on the rising time and with it the end of the age of tyrantsoh rightcrokus if youre serious about all this darujhistans history is where well begin in the lessons but that doesnt mean starting at volume five it means starting at the very beginningcrokus nodded born on a rumour he saidat the desk moby squawked then coughed mammot shot him a glance then swung his attention back to crokus expression veiled as he replied yes lad darujhistan was born on a rumour he hesitatedyouve heard that saying elsewhere recentlysomeone mentioned it crokus said casually cant recall who though he could in fact it had been spoken by the assassin rallick nom do you know what it meanscrokus shook his headmammot leaned back drink your tea my lad the old man paused then began in the early cycles in this realm three great people struggled for dominion none of them human as we would know human bowing out early in the struggle were the forkrul assail or the krussa as they are now known not through weakness but well disinterestthe remaining two peoples warred endlessly eventually one fell for they were a race of individuals battling as much among themselves as against their racial enemies they were called the jaghut though the term has degenerated these days to jhag or shurl while losers in the war they did not disappear entirelyits said some jaghut survive to this day though thankfully not on genabackisso mammot cupped his hands around his teacup darujhistan was born on a rumour among the indigenous gadrobi hill tribes survived the legend that a jaghuts barrow lay somewhere in the hills now the jaghut were possessors of great magic creators of secret warrens and items of power over time the gadrobi legend made its way beyond the hills into the genabackan north and the catlin south to kingdoms since crumbled to dust in the east and west in any case searchers came to the hills at first a trickle then hordesentire tribes led by powerhungry shamans and warlocks every hillside was laced with trenches and boreholes from the camps and shantytowns from the thousands of treasureseekers arriving each spring a city was borndarujhistan crokus saidyes the barrow was never found and the rumour has long since dwindledfew are even aware of it these days and those who are know better than to resume the searchwhymammot frowned rarely does a jaghut construction appear in the hands of a human but it has happened and the consequences have inevitably been catastrophic the old mans frown deepened the lesson is clear for those who would choose to recognize itcrokus thought for a time so the krussail vanished the jhag were defeated what happened to the third people then the ones who won why arent they here instead of usmammot opened his mouth to reply then stopped reconsideringcrokuss eyes narrowed he wondered what mammot had been about to reveal and why hed chosen not to reveal itmammot set down his cup no one is certain what happened to them crokus or how they became what they are today they exist sort of and are known to all who have faced the malazan empire as the tlan imasssorry pushed through the crowd struggling to keep the fat man within sight it was not that he was difficult to follow but the girl was struggling against a storm within her head which had been triggered by a single word uttered by sergeant whiskeyjackseerit had felt as if a dark compacted thing in her brain had burst open with that word and now warred against all that surrounded it though it had initially come upon her with a force that seemed almost overwhelming she could now sense ws waymamp whatenet it fought was winning the battle yet faintly she thought she could hear the weeping of a childi am cotillion she heard herself murmur patron of assassins known to all as the rope of shadow the weeping grew fainter the seer is deada part of her mind cried out at that while another asked what seeri am within yet apart i stand at shadowthrones side and he is named ammanas and he is the lord of shadows i am here as the hand of death sorry smiled and nodded to herself once again in controlwhatever had challenged that was now gone once more buried deep inside the luxury of weeping of anger of fear did not belong to her had never belonged to hershe drew a deep breath and her senses narrowed to the task at hand the fat little man was dangerous the how and why of this remained to be answered but every power hissed in alarm each time she caught glimpse of him amid the crowds and all that is dangerous she told herself must diebeneath the second tier wall in the lakefront the market along st walk was at its usual frenzied peak the sour heat building all day in the cluttered avenues and alleys was at its height sweating exhausted merchants screamed curses at competitors over the heads of customers fights broke out every few minutes in one or another area the turl jostle of the crowds pulling the contestants apart long before the arrival of illtempered guardssquatting on their grass mats local rhivi plainsmen called out in d nasal singsong endless descriptions of fine horseflesh at intersections gadrobi herders stood at tethering poles surrounded by braying goats and sheep while others pushed wooden carts burdened with cheeses and clay jugs filled with fermented milk daru fishermen walked with spof smoked fish bobbing above their heads streaming with buzzing flies catlin weavers sat behind waisthigh fortresses comprised of bolts of brightly dyed cloth gredfalan farmers stood in their wagons selling seasons bitter fruits and sweet tubers woodsellers forced their drawn wagons through the crowds their children clinging to the stacked bundles of wood like monkeys darkrobed men and women of callows sang out the clashing claims of their thousand sects of d each holding aloft their sects particular iconkruppe strode down the market street with a jaunty step his arms waving about seemingly of their own accord such movement however was no mere affectation it disguised the gesturing required for casting spells as a thief it appeared that kruppes tastes did not demand muchhe stole foodfruit and sweets mostlyand it was to such desires of the palate that he had honed his skills of magicas he walked the chaotic dance of his arms was timed to catch apples flying from baskets pastries leaping from trays chocolatecovered cherries plucked from pans all moving so swiftly as to be no more than blurs dodging bodies in their path inside the wide flopping sleeves of his coat pockets had been sewn some large some tiny all that entered kruppes hands disappeared up his sleeves tucked into appropriately sized pockets he strode on a connoisseur of edible delicacies of a hundred cultures an expression of sated contentment on his round faceeventually after a long circuitous route kruppe arrived at the phoenix inn he paused on the steps and chatted with a lone thug standing there removing from a sleeve a glazed honeyball then taking a bite from the sweetmeat he pushed open the door and disappeared insidehalf a block down the street sorry propped herself against the pitted wall of a tenement and crossed her arms the fat little man was a wonder shed seen enough of his exquisite ballet to recognize him as an adept yet she felt confused for the mind behind the mans faade hinted at capacities far greater than those hed shown confirmation that here indeed was a dangerous creaturefrom where she stood she studied the inn the man on the steps seemed to be screening everyone entering but she couldnt detect any gesture that might indicate a thieves cant the conversations were brief usually of mutual recognition nevertheless she intended to enter the innit was the kind of place whiskeyjack had sent kalam and quick ben to finda haunt of thieves strongarms and assassins why the sergeant wanted to find such a place was a detail that hadnt been shared with herthe wizard and kalam had suspicions about her and she sensed that their arguments were swaying whiskeyjack if they could theyd keep her out of everything but she didnt intend that to happenpushing herself from the wall sorry crossed the street and approached the phoenix inn overhead the afternoon had waned into a thick heavy dusk the smell of rain in the air as she neared the front steps the thugs attention focused on her the man grinned following kruppe around eh he wagged his head girls shouldnt carry swords anyway hope youre not planning to go inside with a sword uh uh not unescorted sorry stepped back she glanced up and down the street the nearest pedestrian was over a street away heading in the opposite direction she closed her hands around the edges of her halfcloak and drew it around her waist let me pass she said quietly how had that fat man spotted herthe man leaned on the railing all this is just begging for some kind of conversation friendlylike he said so how about you and me go back to the alley you lay down your sword and ill be gentle otherwise things could get rough and what would be the fun of sorrys left hand darted out a dagger flashed between them the blade entered the mans right eye and then his brain he jerked back over the rail and fell landing with a heavy thud beside the steps sorry walked up to him and retrieved her dagger she paused adjusting the belt that carried her duelling sword then checked the street seeing no one close enough to have noticed anything awry in the deepening gloom she climbed the steps and entered the innshe was stopped before shed taken her second step coming facetoface with a moaning boy hanging upside down two roughlooking women were taking turns to swing him back and forth every time he tried to reach up to the rope tied to his feet he earned a knock on the head one of the women grinned at sorryhey now the woman said grasping sorrys arm as she walked bysorry turned a cold eye on the woman whatthe woman leaned close her breath a mist of beer as she whispered you get in trouble you just call for irilta and meese thats us rightthank yousorry resumed her walk shed already seen the fat little manwhat had the thug called him kruppe hed seated himself at a table near the far wall beneath the gallery through the crowded room sorry saw a space open at the bar where she might take position and observe she pushed forwardsince kruppe evidently knew of her she decided to make no effort in hiding her attention often that was exactly the kind of pressure that cracked a mans will in a war of patience sorry smiled inwardly the mortal is ever at a disadvantagecrokus turned the corner and approached the phoenix inn the course mammot had set for him was intimidating the education extending far beyond books to the etiquette of court manners the functions of various officials bloodlines and particular quirks among certain dignitariesbut hed vowed to himself hed follow it through his goal was one day to stand before that darle maiden awaiting a formal introductionsomething in him mocked the image there stands crokus the scholar the sophisticated young promise the thief it was all too absurdyet it dogged him steeled his resolve hed come to it one day soonuntil then however there were other matters to attend to things that needed redressingas he came up to the inns steps he saw a huddled shadow beneath the railing cautiously crokus moved closeras sorry reached the bar the door slammed open on the other side of the room she turned with everyone else to see a young blackhaired man standing theresomeones murdered chert the man shouted hes been knifedhalf a dozen patrons surged to the door pushing past the young man and disappearing outsidesorry faced the bar again catching the barmans eye she said gredfalan ale please in a pewter tankardthe woman irilta had called meese appeared beside her thumping two broad forearms on the bar as she leaned forward attend the lady scurve meese growled she got tastemeese dipped her head close to sorrys good taste all round chert was a pig sorry stiffened her hands slipped down beneath her cloakeasy girl meese said in a low tone we aint wagging tongues around here y take care of yourselves first and i dont want no knife in my eye we said wed take care of you didnt wethe ale arrived as ordered sorry raised a hand and closed it on the tankards handle you dont want to take care of me meese she said quietlyanother person arrived on meeses other side glancing at him sorry saw that it was the blackhaired youth his face pale dammit meese he hissed im having a really bad daymeese chuckled and draped an arm over his shoulders scurve serve us up a couple of them gredfalan ales crokus heres earned darujhistans best meese turned her head and bent close to sorry againnext time she whispered you dont want to show that kind of breeding not around here anywaysorry frowned down at her drink shed been careless ordering the citys best then she took a mouthful thats fine she said fine indeedmeese grinned nudging crokus the lady likes it just finecrokus leaned forward offering sorry a weary but warm smile from outside came the klaxon of the guardscurve served up the two alessorry watched crokuss gaze move down her body then stop th youths smile tightened his face whitening even more than before as the tankard was set before him crokus averted his eyes and reached for itpay up before you drink that crokus scurve muttered youre getting to be just as bad as kruppecrokus reached into his pocket and pulled out a handful of coins a he tried to count them some slipped between his fingers and bounced on the bar of the three that fell two clattered briefly then stopped the third coin spun and continued spinning sorrys eyes swung to it as did scurves and meeses crokus reached for it then hesitated the coin was still spinning its momentum unchangedsorry stared at the coin feeling echoes of power slam into her skull like ocean waves from within all at once came an answering surge scurve shouted as the coin skidded across the bar bounced once big into the air then clattered to a stop directly in front of crokusno one spoke beyond their small ring no one else had witnessed the eventcrokus thrust his hand forward and collected the coin not this one he gratedfine scurve answered in a similar hoarse voice he reached shaking hands to gather in the other coins crokus had laid on the barbeneath the counter sorry brushed her hand against her daggers hilt and scabbard it came away wet so crokus had seen the blood she would have to kill him only her frown deepened she knew she wouldntcrokus my boy came a shout from under the gallerymeese sneered in that direction the flopping fish himself she muttered kruppe calls ladcrokus snorted having returned the coin to his pocket he picked up his tankard later meeseso shed found oponns manas easily as that and he was connected to kruppe somehow this was almost too simple it made her suspicious a likely lad meese said me and irilta we look out for him rightsorry leaned against the bar her eyes on the tankard in her hand shed have to play this very carefully that burst of shadow sorcery responding to the coins influence had been entirely instinctive right meese she said no worries on that count ok meese sighed ok lets try for the cheap stuff now scurve dar beer if you please earthenware if you have itcrouched against the second tier wall on the lakefront side was quip bar a common haunt of shipmen and fisherhands the bars walls were cut sandstone and over time the whole edifice had developed a backward lean as if withdrawing from the front street quips now sagged against the second tier wall as did the adjoining squatter shacks constructed mostly of driftwood and hull planks washed ashore from the occasional wreck out on moles reefdusk brought a light rain to darujhistan the mists crawling in from the water and on to the shore far out over the lake lightning flashed but too distant for thunder to be heardkalam emerged from quips bar just as a local greyface brought his burning pitchstick to a nearby gaslight having moments earlier opened the copper valves the lamp ignited in a flash of blue flame that quickly evened out kalam paused outside the bar to watch the odd greyrobed man continue on down the street he squinted skyward then moved up the street he came to the last squatter shack this one abutting a peculiar jag in the tier wall and enteredquick ben looked up from his crosslegged position in the centre of the dirt floor any luckno kalam said the guilds gone to groundwhy ive no idea he went to the far wall and sat down on his bedroll he leaned back against the ancient pitted stone and eyed his comrade you think maybe the city councils moved to take out the local assassinsquick bens gaze glittered in the gloom you mean anticipating wed try to make contactkalam looked away i doubt theyre idiots they must know its the malazan way offer the guild a contract it cant refuse then sit back and watch the rulers drop like headless flies whiskeyjack suggested the plan dujek okd it those two were talking the old emperors language there quick the old man must be laughing in hell right nowthe wizard shivered an unpleasant imageshrugging kalam continued its all academic anyway if we cant find a local assassin wherever they are its not in lakefront district id swear to that the only name i picked up thats got mystery around it is someone named the eel not an assassin though something elsewhere next then quick ben asked gadrobi districtno just a bunch of farmers and herders there hell the smell alone coming from that place is enough to cross it off the list well try daru starting tomorrow kalam hesitated what about your side of thingsquick ben bowed his head when he answered it was a faint whisperalmost readywhiskeyjack nearly choked when he heard your proposal so did i youll be walking into the vipers den quick you sure its necessaryno quick ben looked up personally id rather we just dropped everything and ran away from it all from the empire from darujhistan from war but try convincing the sergeant to do that hes loyal to an idea and thats the hardest kind to turnkalam nodded honour integrity all that expensive crapright so we do it this way because its the only way left to us hairlocks insanity has become a liability but we can use him still one last time power draws power and with luck hairlocks demise will do just that the more ascendants we can lure into the fray the betteri always thought that was something to avoid quickthe wizards smile was strained tell me about it but right now the more confusion and chaos the betterand if tayschrenn catches windquick bens smile broadened then were dead all that much sooner so it goeskalam barked a short humourless laugh so it goesthe wizard cocked his head the suns past the horizon time to startyou want me out of here kalam askedquick ben shook his head no i want you right where you are for this one if i dont come back take my body and burn it down to ash scatter the ash to the four winds and curse my name with all your heartkalam was silent then he asked in a growl how long do i waitdawn quick ben replied you understand i would only ask this of my closest friendi understand now get on with it dammitquick ben gestured a ring of fire sprang from the earth surrounding the wizard he closed his eyesto kalam his friend seemed to deflate slightly as if something essential to life had disappeared quick bens neck creaked as his chin sank down to his chest his shoulders slumped and a long breath escaped with a slow hiss the ring of fire flared then dimmed to a lapping glimmer on the earthkalam shifted position stretching out his legs and crossing his armsin the gathering silence he waiteda pale murillio returned to the table and sat down someones disposing of the body he said then shook his head whoever killed chert was a professional with a real nasty streak right through the eyeenough kruppe cried out raising his hands kruppe happens to be eating dear murillio and kruppe also happens to have a delicate stomachchert was a fool murillio continued ignoring kruppe but hardly the type to attract such viciousnesscrokus said nothing hed seen the blood on that darkhaired womans daggerwho can say kruppe waggled his eyebrows perhaps he was witness to some horrific horror perhaps he was stamped out as a man crushes a cute mouse underfootcrokus glanced around his eyes returned to the woman standing with meese at the bar dressed in leather armour with a plain duelling sword strapped to her hip she reminded him of the time hed watched as a young boy a troop of mercenaries ride through the city they had been the crimson guard he recalled five hundred men and women without a shiny buckle among themhis gaze remained on the woman like a mercenary a killer for whom killing had long since lost its horror what had chert done to earn a knife in the eyecrokus looked away in time to see rallick nom enter the bar the assassin approached the table seemingly unconscious of the locals moving from his pathcoll intercepted him before he reached the table the burly man slapped rallicks back and leaned drunkenly against him nom you old bastardrallick threw an arm around colls round shoulders and together they came to the tablekruppe looked up ho my dear comrades kruppe invites you to join our familiar gathering waving his arms at the two empty chairs he rocked back in his seat to bring you up to date on our dramatic doings the lad crokus has been staring dreamily into space while murillio and kruppe have discussed the latest natterings of the street ratscoll remained standing weaving unsteadily a frown knitting his brows rallick sat down and reached for the pitcher of beer what natterings are those the assassin asked casuallythe rurnour that were now allied with moons spawn murillio saidnonsense of course kruppe said have you seen anything to suggest such a thingmurillio grinned the moon hasnt moved away has it not only that theres that council tent stationed directly under itcrokus spoke up i heard from uncle mammot that the councilmen havent had any luck getting a message to whoevers in moons spawntypical murillio commented his eyes narrowing briefly on rallickwho lives in there crokus askedcoll tottered and threw both hands down on the table to steady himself he thrust his red face at crokus and bellowed five black dragonswithin the warren of chaos quick ben knew of the innumerable shifting pathways that led to doors though he called them doors they were in fact barriers created where warrens touched an accretion of energy as solid as basalt chaos touched on all realms with gnarled fingertips bleeding power the doors hardened wounds in the flesh of other worlds other avenues of magicthe wizard had focused his talents on such doors while within the warren of chaos he had learned the ways of shaping their energy hed found means of altering the barriers of sensing what lay beyond themeach warren of magic possessed a smell each realm a texture and though the pathways he took were never the same as those hed taken before he had mastered the means of finding those he soughthe travelled now down one of those paths a track of nothingness enclosed by the warrens own accretions twisting and fraught with contradictions on one trail hed will himself forward yet find himself moving back hed come to a sharp right turn followed by another then another then yet anotherall in the same directionhe knew it was the power of his mind that opened the pathways but they had their own lawsor perhaps they were his yet unknown to himwhatever the source of the shaping it was madness definedhe came at last to the door he sought the barrier showed as nothing more than a dull slategrey stone hovering before it quick ben whispered a command and his spirit took the form of his own body he stood a moment mastering the disconnected tremble of his ghostbody then stepped forward and laid hands on the doorits edges were hard and warm towards the centre it grew hot and soft to the touch the surface slowly lost its opaqueness beneath the wizards hands becoming glassy like obsidian quick ben closed his eyeshed never before sought to pass through such a door he was not even certain that it was possible and if he survived into the beyond was there any way to return past the mechanics of the one thing loomed his final most difficult worry he was about to attempt entry into a realm where he wasnt welcomequick ben opened his eyes i am direction he said quietly he leaned against the barrier i am the power of will in a place that respects this and only this he leaned harder i am the warrens touch to chaos nothing is immune nowhere is immune he felt the door begin to yieldhe lashed out one hand behind him fending off a growing pressureonly i shall pass he hissed abruptly with a strange thumping sound he slipped through energy flaring around his bodythe wizard staggered over rough parched earth he regained his balance and looked around he stood on a barren plain the horizon off to his left humped with low hills overhead spanned a sky the colour of quicksilver a scatter of long stringy clouds moving in unison and black as ink directly abovequick ben sat down folding his legs and clasping his hands in his lapshadowthrone he said lord of shadows i am come to your realm will you receive my presence as befits a peaceful visitorfrom the hills came an answer the howling of houndschapter twelvewalk with me on thieves road hear its song underfoot how clear its tone in misstep as it sings you in twoapsalars cant drisbin bing his brow kruppe sat reading in mammots study and in the calling down to earth the god was crippled and so chained in its place in the calling down many lands were sundered by the gods fists and things were born and things were releasedchained and crippled was this god kruppe glanced up from the ancient tome and rolled his eyes brevity kruppe prays for brevity he returned to the faded handwritten scriptand it bred caution in the unveiling of its powers the crippled god bred caution but not well enough for the powers of the earth came to it in the end chained was the crippled god and so chained was it destroyed and upon this barren plain that imprisoned the crippled god many gathered to the deed hood grey wanderer of death was among the gathering as was dessembrae then hoods warriorthough it was here and in this time that dessembrae shattered the bonds hood held upon him also among the gathering were irkruppe groaned and flipped pages the list seemed interminable absurdly long from this account he half expected to see his grandmothers name among those listed finally after three pages he found the names he soughtand among those that came from the vaulted heavens of silver the tiste and dwellers of darkness in the place before light black dragons numbering five and in their league sailed redwinged silanah said to dwell among the tiste and in their fang of darkness descending from the vaulted heavens of silver kruppe nodded muttering to himself a descending fang of darknessmoons spawn home to five black dragons and one red dragon he shivered how had coll come upon this true the man hadnt always been a drunken lout but even his past station lofty as it was hadnt been the scholarly kindwho then had spoken through the old mans winestained mouththat kruppe sighed to himself shall have to wait its answer the significance however of colls bellowed claim lies in its evident truth and as to how it pertains to the present situation he closed the book and rose to his feet behind him he heard footstepsive brought you herbal tea the old man said as he entered the closetsized room has alladarts realm compendium been beneficial kruppebeneficial indeed kruppe said gratefully accepting the earthenware mug kruppe has learned the value of modern language such longlipped dribbles common to those ancient scholars are a curse kruppe is thankful to find extinct in our timeah ha the old man said coughing slightly and looking away well do you mind if i ask what you were seekingkruppe glanced up the corners of his eyes crinkling slightly not at all mammot i thought to find mention of my grandmothers namemammot frowned then nodded i see well ill not inquire as to your luck thenplease do not kruppe said eyes widening luck is such a dreadful companion these days with all awry as all happens to be but thank you for understanding kruppes need for circumspectionnot at all mammot said waving one hand i didnt mean towell yes i did curiosity you understand the intellectual kindkruppe smiled beatifically and sipped teawell mammot said shall we return to the common room then and find respite before the hearththey strode into the other chamber once seated kruppe stretched out his legs and leaned back how has your writing been coming along he askedslow mammot answered as one would expect of courseit seemed mammot was working up to something and so kruppe waited idly wiggling his toes a minute passed then the old man clear his throat and spoke kruppe have you seen much of my dear nephew latelykruppe raised his eyebrows long ago he said kruppe made promise to a man the man being a concerned uncle to a young boy who found the streets an exciting playground aye the lad dreamed of sword fights and dark deeds committed in alleys on behalf of princesses in disguise or some such thingmammot was nodding his eyes closedand to such promises kruppe has availed of himself thoroughly he too loved the boy and as with any endeavour survival is measured in ability and so did kruppe take the lad under his silken wing with some success yes mammot smiled still noddingand so to answer the uncles question indeed kruppe has seen the lad mammot leaned forward and fixed kruppe with an intense gaze have you seen anything odd in his actions i mean has he asked you any strange questions made any requestskruppes eyes narrowed he paused to drink bluntly yes for one he sought the return of a fine cache of jewellery he acquired recently personal reasonsas he said personal reasons kruppe wondered then and wonders now but the lads seeming sincerity nay focused intensity struck kruppe as laudableagreed would you believe crokus has now expressed an interest in formal education i cant understand it the boys positively obsessed about somethingperhaps then kruppe should piece this togetherthank you mammot said relieved i would know where all this coming from so much ambition all at once i fear it may soon burn it out if we can nourish it howeverby all means kruppe said there is more to life than petty thievery after allmammot grinned why kruppe im surprised to hear that coming from yousuch comments are better left between you and kruppe in any case i believe murillio knows something of all this he intimated as much this evening while we dined at the phoenix innmammot asked is murillio wellkruppe smiled the net about the lad remains intact he said for one rallick nom has taken the responsibility seriously indeed mayhap he sees something of his own lost youth in crokus in truth rallick is a man whose true nature escapes kruppe fiercely loyal for certain and one who as you well know honours his debts with such vigour as to humble those around him excepting kruppe naturally yet is it blood that travels his veins one must wonder at timesa distant look had entered mammots facekruppe tensed the air smelled of magic he leaned forward and studied the old man seated across from him someone was communicating with mammot and the warren that now pulsed in the room was familiar to kruppehe sat back and waitedeventually mammot got swiftly to his feet i have some research to do he said distractedly as for you kruppe master baruk wishes to speak with you immediatelyi thought i sensed the alchemists presence kruppe said rising with a soft grunt ah the rigours of these fated nights ever urge us on until later then mammotgoodbye the scholar said a frown on his face as he crossed the room he entered the small chamber where kruppe had spent the past hourkruppe adjusted the sleeves of his cloak whatever had happened it had been enough to jar mammots etiquette and that alone hinted at dire events well he murmured best not keep baruk waiting then at least he amended as he headed for the door not for too long decorum demands that kruppe retain his sense of dignity he shall walk fast yesbut walk he shall for kruppe needs time to think to plan to scheme to anticipate to backtrack with some thoughts to leap ahead with others to do all the things necessary first and foremost kruppe must discern the nature of the woman who followed him and who killed chert and who noted that crokus saw the blood on her weapon and who marked rallick nom as an assassin with his very arrival she might well provide the key to everything and more for the coin did indeed turn its face upon her if only for a moment and that thinks kruppe shall return to us all for good or ill he stopped and looked around blinking rapidlyat the very least he muttered kruppe should leave mammots roomhe glanced back at the chamber mammot had entered from within came the sounds of brittle pages being rapidly turned kruppe sighed in relief then leftcrone ruffled her singed feathers and hopped about in agitation where was that alchemist she had a thousand things to attend to before the night was done though in truth she couldnt think of any of themnevertheless she disliked being kept waitingthe door to the study opened and baruk strode through gathering a robe about his considerable bulk my apologies crone i was otherwise indisposedcrone grunted sorcery trailed from the man in thick pungent streams my master lord anomander rake she said without preamble has commanded that i tell you what i told him of my adventures on the rhivi plainbaruk came up to where the great raven paced on the map table the alchemist frowned youve been injuredpride no more hearken then to my storybaruk raised an eyebrow the old witchs mood was dark he fell silent and she begana small wooden puppet approaches from the north a creation of soulshifting and sourced from a warren of chaos its power is immense twisted malign even to great ravens it killed many of my kin as it slipped in and out of its warren it evidently took pleasure in such actscrone snapped her beak in anger then continued it pursues a power i could not approach and whatever this power it strikes directly for the gadrobi hillsmy lord and i are agreed in this the power seeks something within those hills yet we are not native to this land hence we bring this news to you alchemist two forces are converging on the gadrobi hills my lord asks you whybaruks face had lost all its colour he turned slowly and walked to a chair sitting down he steepled his hands before his face and closed his eyes the malazan empire seeks something it cannot hope to control something buried within the gadrobi hills whether or not either force is capable of freeing that thing is another matter seeking is not the same as finding and finding is not the same as succeedingcrone hissed impatiently who is buried there alchemista jaghut tyrant imprisoned by the jaghut themselves generations of scholars and sorcerers have sought to find this barrow none managed to discover even so much as a clue baruk looked up his expression lined with worry i know of one man here in darujhistan who has gathered all the available knowledge concerning this burial place i must confer with him i can give your lord this however there lies a standing stone in the gadrobi hillsi know its location precisely it is almost invisible only its weathered top breaks the ground nealy a hands span in height the remaining twenty feet are beneath the earth you will see the remnants of many pits and trenches that have been excavated around itall fruitless for while the stone marks the beginning pointit is not the entrance to the barrowwhere then is this entrancethat i will not tell you once i speak with my colleague perhaps i can give you more details perhaps not but the means by which the barrow is entered must remain a secretthis avails us nothing my lordis extremely powerful baruk cut in his intentions are anything but clear crone no matter that we are allied what lies within that barrow can destroy a citythis city that i will not allow to enter rakes handsyou shall have the location of the standing stone for it is there that the hunters must first go i have one question to ask crone this puppet are you certain it pursues this other powercrone bobbed her head it tracks it hides when necessary you assume both powers are malazan whybaruk grunted first they want darujhistan theyll do anything to win it theyve had access to vast libraries among the lands theyve conquered the jaghut barrow is no secret in and of itself second you said both powers came down from the north they can only be malazanwhy one hides from the other is beyond me though i wouldnt doubt that there are competing factions within the empireany political entity as large as that one is bound to be rife with discord in any case they pose a direct threat to darujhistan and by extension to your lords desires to prevent the malazan empire from conquering us assuming that the powers are malazan seems warrantedcrones displeasure was obvious you will be kept informed of the activities on the rhivi plain my lord must decide whether to intercept these powers before they reach the gadrobi hills she turned an angry eye on baruk he has received little assistance from his allies i trust when we next speak that situation will be remediedthe alchemist shrugged my first meeting with anomander rake has proved my only meeting with him assistance demands communicationhis tone hardened inform your lord that the present dissatisfaction exists with us as much as it does with himmy lord has been busy with his side of things crone muttered flapping to the windowsillbaruk stared at the bird as she prepared to leave busy he asked darkly in what wayin due time alchemist crone purred a moment later she was gonebaruk cursed and with an angry gesture returned the window to its place and slammed the shutters doing this through magic and from a distance was not as satisfying as it would have been had he done it physically grumbling he rose and walked to the mantelpiece as he poured himself some wine he paused less than half an hour ago hed conjured a demon it was not an ambitious conjuring hed needed a spy not a killer something told him hed be calling upon far deadlier creatures in the near future he scowled then took a mouthful of winemammot he whispered as he opened his warren i need youhe smiled as a scene appeared in his head of a small room and a stone hearth seated in the chair opposite his point of view was kruppe good i need you boththe hound that approached quick ben was wide and heavy its fur a pasty white as it trotted up to the wizard he saw that its eyes were also white the creature possessed no pupils it stopped a short distance away and sat quick ben bowed you are the hound called blind he said mate to baran and mother of gear i come seeking no harm i would speak with your masterhe heard a growl beside him and froze slowly he turned his head an looked down less than a foot from his right leg lay another hound mottled brown and tan lean and scarred its eyes were fixed on blind baran he nodded another growl answered barans this one behind the wizard he turned further to see ten feet away a third hound this one long black and sleek its eyes fixed on him glowed red and shan he said quietly he faced blind again have you found your quarry or are you my escortbaran rose silently beside him its shoulders level with his chest blind stood then trotted off to the left she stopped and looked back twin growls spurred quick ben after themthe land around them changed slowly details slipping into sourceles shadows and reemerging subtly altered on what the wizard thought of as the north horizon a grey forest climbed a slope to what might have been a wall this wall was in place of skymaybe it was skybut to quick ben it looked strangely close even though the forest was leagues away glancing overhead did not help him confirm or refute his feeling that this realm was bordered by a magical wall for it too seemed close almost within reach yet black clouds rode winds above him skewing his perceptions and making him dizzyanother hound had joined their company this one a male was dark grey one of its eyes blue the other yellow though it didnt come close quick ben judged that it was the largest of those around him and its movement hinted at deadly speed he knew it as doan first born to the packs leader rood and its first mate pallickdoan trotted alongside blind for a time then when they came to the crest of a low rise he bolted forward reaching the crest quick ben saw their destination he sighed just as the image carved upon the altar within the temples dedicated to shadowthrone shadowkeep rose from the plain like an enormous lump of black glass fractured with curving planes rippled in places with some corners glistening white as if crushed the largest surface facing thema wall he supposedwas mottled and dull as if it was a cortex the weathered surface of obsidianthere were no windows as such but many of the slick surfaces looked semitranslucent and seemed to glow with an inner light as far as quick ben could see there was no door no gate no drawbridgethey arrived and the wizard exclaimed in surprise as blind strode into the stone and disappeared he hesitated and boran came as close to nudging him as quick ben allowed he walked up to the mottled stone and held out his hands as he stepped into it he felt nothing passing through effortlessly to find himself in a hallway that could have been found in any mundane estatebarren of trappings the corridor led straight forward for perhaps thirty feet and ended at double doors blind and doan sat to either side of these doors which now opened of their own accordquick ben entered the room beyond the chamber was domed opposite him stood a simple obsidian throne on a slightly raised dais the dull cobbled floor bore no rugs and the walls were bare except for torches spaced every ten feet quick ben counted forty but the light was fitful seeming to struggle against encroaching shadowsat first he thought the throne unoccupied but as he approached he saw the figure seated there it seemed composed of almost translucent shadows vaguely human in form but hooded preventing even the glint of eyes still quick ben could feel the gods attention fixed solely on him and he barely repressed a shivershadowthrone spoke his voice calm and clear shan tells me you know the names of my houndsquick ben stopped before the dais he bowed i was once an acolyte within your temple lordthe god was silent for a time then he said is it wise to admit such a thing wizard do i look kindly upon those who once served me but then abandoned my ways tell me i would hear from you what my priests teachto begin upon the path of shadow and then to leave it is rewarded by the ropemeaningi am marked for assassination by all who follow your ways lordyet here you stand wizardquick ben bowed again i would strike a deal lordthe god giggled then raised a hand no dear shan strike naughtquick ben stiffened the black hound stepped around him and ascended the dais she lay down before her god and eyed the wizard blanklydo you know why i just saved your life wizardi do lordshadowthrone leaned forward shan wants you to tell mequick ben met the hounds red stare shadowthrone loves dealsthe god sighed and sank back acolyte indeed well then wizard speak on while you cani must begin with a question lord ask itdoes gear still liveshans eyes flared and she half rose before the gods hand touched her headnow that shadowthrone said is quite a question youve managed something few alas have been able to do wizard my curiosity is piqued so i answer you yes gear survives by all means continuelord i would deliver into your hands the one who offended your houndhow he belongs to oponnnot him lord but the one who led gear to that chamber the one who sought to take gears soul and would have succeeded if not for oponns mortal toolin exchange for whatquick ben cursed inwardly he could read nothing from the gods tone and that made things even trickier than hed expected my life lord i wish the ropes reward lifted from meanything elseyes he hesitated then continued i wish to choose the time and place lord otherwise this one of which i speak will escape your hounds through its warren of chaos only i can prevent thatthus it must be part of the deal all that you need do is have your hounds ready i will call upon you at the proper moment providing you with the creatures precise location the restis up to your houndsyouve planned this well wizard shadowthrone said as of yet i can think of no way to kill both the creature and you i commend you how then do you intend to call upon me surely youll not once again enter my realmlord you will be contacted i guarantee this but i can say no more about itand if i were to lay my powers upon you now wizard if i were to wring whatever lies hidden in that frail brain of yours how would you prevent meto answer that lord you must answer my proposal firstshan growled and this time the god made no motion to still herquick ben went on hastily given that you will seek to betray me at every opportunity given that youll hunt for the weaknesses in my plan given all this i would have your word that you will complete your part of the deal if all else fails you lord give me that and i will answer your last questionshadowthrone was silent for a long minute ah well he muttered your cunning is admirable wizard i am astonished and i must admit delighted by this duel my only regret is that you departed the paths of shadowyou would have risen far very well you have my word the hounds will be ready now why shouldnt i shred your brain here and now wizardyour answer lord is in your very words quick ben raised his armsi did indeed rise far shadowthrone in service to you he opened his warren youll not have me lord because you cant quick ben whispered his word of recall a word born of chaos power burst around him and he felt as if a giant hand had closed around him as it pulled him back into his warren he heard shadowthrones scream of recognitionit is you delad you shapeshifting bastardquick ben smiled hed done it he was out of reach hed done itagainkruppe was ushered into baruks study with none of the delays he was so fond of confounding slightly disappointed he took his seat and wiped his forehead with his handkerchiefbaruk entered you took your time getting here he growled well never mind have you any newskruppe laid his handkerchief on his lap and began carefully to fold itwe continue to protect the coin bearer as instructed as for the presence of malazan infiltrators no luck it was a major lie but necessary i am to convey a message to you he continued most unusual in its source indeed strange in fact was its delivery to kruppeget on with itkruppe winced baruk was in a terrible mood he sighed a message to you personally master he completed folding his handkerchief and looked up from the eelbaruk stiffened then a scowl darkened his features why not he muttered the man even knows who my agents are his gaze cleared and he watched kruppe im waiting he growledof course kruppe shook loose his handkerchief and mopped his brow look to the streets to find those you seek that and no more delivered to kruppe by the smallest child hed ever seen he stopped and shook his head no such exaggeration would never do not with baruks mood as foul as it appeared to be a small child in any casebaruk stood glowering at the dying embers in the fireplace his hands clasped behind his back fingers twisting a large silver ring tell me kruppe he asked slowly what do you know of this eellittle kruppe admits man woman unknown origins a mystery designs perpetuating a status quo defined by aversion to tyranny or so its said influence farreaching even if one discounts nine out of ten rumours associated with the eel his or her agents must number in the hundreds all devoted to protecting darujhistan tis said that councilman turban orr is even now hunting them down convinced theyve ruined all his schemes mayhap they have and for that we can all be relievedbaruk seemed anything but relieved kruppe thought he could almost hear the mans teeth grinding however he turned to kruppe and nodded i have an assignment for it you will need to round up murillio rallick and coll and take the coin bearer with you just to keep him safekruppe raised an eyebrow out of the cityyes paramount is the coin bearerkeep him beyond anyones reach as for your mission you will observe nothing more do you understand me kruppe observe to do anything else will be to risk the coin bearer falling into the wrong hands while he is oponns tool he also is the means by which another ascendant can reach oponn the last thing we need is gods battling on the mortal plainkruppe cleared his throat what are we to observe masterim not sure possibly a foreign work party digging here and therekruppe started as in road repairsthe alchemist frowned i will be sending you to the gadrobi hills remain there until either someone comes or i contact you with further instructions if someone comes kruppe youre to remain hidden avoid detection at all costsuse your warren if need benone shall find kruppe and his worthy loyal comrades kruppe said smiling and waggling his fingersgood that will be all thensurprised kruppe climbed to his feet when are we to leave mastersoon ill let you know at least a day beforehand is that sufficient timeyes friend baruk kruppe deems that more than enough time rallick appears temporarily indisposed but with luck he shall be availableget him if you can if the coin bearers influence turns against us the assassin is charged with killing the boy does he understand thisweve discussed it kruppe saidbaruk inclined his head and fell silentkruppe waited a moment then quietly leftless than an hour after quick bens soul had left the body seated on the huts floor and journeyed into the shadow realm it creaked back into life redeyed with an exhaustion born of unrelenting tension kalam pushed himself to his feet and waited for his friend to come roundthe assassin laid his hands on his longknives just to be on the safe side if quick ben had been taken whatever controlled him might well announce its arrival by attacking anyone within range kalam held his breaththe wizards eyes opened the glaze slipping away as awareness returned he saw kalam and smiledthe assassin released his breath done successyes on both counts hard to believe isnt itkalam found he was grinning uncontrollably he stepped forward and helped quick ben to stand the wizard leaned heavily against him also grinninghe realized who i was just as i left quick bens grin broadened you should have heard him screamwell are you surprised how many high priests burn the robes of their vestmentnot enough if you ask me without temples and priests the gods bloody meddling couldnt touch the mortal realm now that would be paradise right friendperhaps said a voice at the doorway both men turned to see sorry standing within the entrance her halfcloak drawn about her slim bodyshe was wet with rain and only now did kalam notice the water dripping through cracks all around them the assassin stepped away from quick ben to free his hands what are you doing here he demandedyou dream of paradise wizard i wish id heard the entire conversationhow did you find us quick ben askedsorry stepped inside and pushed back her hood ive found an assassin she said ive marked him he is in a place called the phoenix inn in the daru district are you interested she asked dully eyeing both meni want answers kalam said in a low voicequick ben backed to the far wall to give the assassin room and to prepare his spells if need bethough he was in no real shape to manage his warren at the moment nor he noticed did kalam look up to a scrap not that the assassin would allow that to stop him right now he was at his most dangerousthat low tone had said it allsorry held her dead eyes on kalam the sergeant has sent me to youa lie kalain interjected softly whiskeyjack doesnt know where we arevery well i sensed your power wizard it has a notable signaturequick ben was stunned but i established a shield around this place he saidyes i too was surprised wizard usually i cannot find you it seems cracks appearedquick ben thought about that cracks he decided wasnt the right wordbut sorry didnt know that shed sensed his whereabouts because she was what theyd suspected a pawn of the rope the shadow realm had been linked however briefly and however tenuously to his flesh and blood yet none but a servant of shadow possessed the necessary sensitivity to detect that link the wizard moved to stand beside kalam and laid a hand on the burly mans shoulderkalam threw him a startled glareshes right cracks appeared kalam shes obviously a natural talent in the ways of sorcery come on friend the girls found what weve been looking for lets move on itsorry pulled up the hood around her head i am not accompanying you she said youll know the man when you see him i suspect it is his task to make his profession obvious perhaps the guild is anticipating you in any case find the phoenix innwhat the hell are you up to kalam demandedi will be completing an assignment for the sergeant she turned and left the hutkalams shoulders slumped and he let out a long breathshes the one we thought her to be quick ben said quietly so far so goodin other words the assassin growled if id attacked her id be a dead man right nowexactly well take her out when the times right but for now we need herkalain noddedphoenix inndamn right and when we get there the first thing im doing is buying a drinkquick ben smiled agreedrallick looked up as the heavyset man entered the bar his black skin marked him a southerner which in itself was not unusual what caught rallicks attention however was the hornhandled silverpommelled longknives tucked into the mans narrow belt those weapons were anything but southern and stamped on the pornmels was a crosshatched pattern recognizable to all within the trade as the mark of an assassinthe man swaggered into the room as if he owned it and none of the locals he shouldered aside seemed inclined to disagree with him he reached the bar and ordered an alerallick studied the dregs in his own tankard obviously the man wanted to be marked precisely by someone like rallick nom a guild assassin so who was the bait then this didnt fitocelot his clan leader was convinced along with everyone else in the guild that empire claws had come into the city and now waged war against them rallick wasnt so sure the man standing at the bar could as easily be seven cities as a traveller from callows he had the look of malazan empire about him was he claw if so why show himself up until now the enemy hadnt left a single clue or a single eyewitness as to their identity the brazenness he now observed either didnt fit or marked a reversal of tactics had vorcans order to go to ground triggered italarm bells rang in rallicks head none of this felt rightmurillio leaned close to him something wrong friendguild business rallick replied you thirstymurillio grinned an offer i cant refuseafter a single bemused glance at colls unconscious form slumped in the chair the assassin left the table what had all that been about five black dragons he made his way to the bar as he pushed through the crowd he gave one youth a hard elbow to the back the boy gasped then surreptitiously slipped towards the kitchenrallick arrived called scurve over then ordered another pitcherthough he did not look the mans way he knew hed been marked by him it was no more than a feeling but one hed learned to trust he sighed as scurve delivered the foaming pitcher well hed done what ocelot had demanded of him though he suspected his clan leader would be asking for morehe returned to the table and conversed with murillio for a time plying his friend with the majority of the ale murillio sensed a growing tension around rallick and took his cue he drained the last of his drink and rose well he said kruppes scurried off crokus too and colls once again dead to the world rallick i thank you for the ale time to find a warm bed until the morrow thenrallick remained seated for another five minutes only once brushing gazes with the black man leaning against the bar then he rose and strode into the kitchen the two cooks rolled their eyes at each other as he strode past rallick ignored them he came to the door which had been left ajar in hopes of a cooling draught the alley beyond was wet though the rain had passed from a shadowed recess on the wall opposite the inn stepped a familiar figurerallick walked up to ocelot its done your man is the big black one nursing an ale two daggers hatchmarked he looks mean and not one id like to tussle with hes all yours ocelotthe mans pocked face twisted hes still inside good head back in make sure youve been noticeddamn sure nomrallick crossed his arms im sure already he drawledyoure to draw him out lead him into tarlows warehouseinto the loading grounds ocelot sneered vorcans orders nom and when you head out do it by the front door no mistakes nothing subtlethe mans an assassin rallick grated if im not subtle hell know its a trap and crawl all over me in seconds flatyou do as vorcan wills nom now get back insiderallick stared at his commander to make his disgust plain then returned to the kitchen the cooks grinned at him but only for moment one look at rallicks face was enough to kill any humour in the room they bent to their tasks as if prodded by a landmasterrallick entered the main room then stopped dead in his tracks damn he muttered the black man was gone now what he shrugged front door it is he made his way through the crowdin an alley on one side of which ran a high stone wall crokus leaned against the damp bricks of a merchants house and gazed steadily at a window it was on the third floor beyond the wall and behind it shuttered face was a room he knew intimatelythered been a light on inside for most of the two hours hed stood below but for the last fifteen minutes the room within had been darknumb with exhaustion and plagued with doubts crokus pulled his cloak tighter around him he wondered what he was doing here and not for the first time all his resolve seemed to have drained into the gutters along with the rainhad it been the darkhaired woman in the phoenix inn had she rattled him that much the blood on her dagger made it obvious that she wouldnt hesitate to kill him just to keep her secret intact maybe it was the spinning coin that had him so confused nothing about that incident had been naturalwhat was so wrong with his dream of being introduced to the darle maiden it had nothing to do with that killer woman in the barnothing he mumbled then scowled now he was talking aloud to himselfa thought came to him that deepened his scowl everything had begun its mad unravelling the night hed robbed the maiden if only he hadnt paused if only he hadnt looked upon her soft round lovely facea groan escaped him and he shifted his feet a highborn that was the real problem wasnt itit all seemed so stupid now so absurd how could he have convinced himself that such a thing as meeting her was possible he shook himselfit didnt matter hed planned this now it was time to do iti dont believe this he muttered as he pushed himself from the wall and headed down the alley his hand brushed the pouch tied to his waistim about to put a maidens ransom backhe came to the stone wall hed been looking for and began to climbhe drew a deep breath all right lets get it donethe stone was wet but he had enough determination in him to scale a mountain he climbed on and did not slip even so much as a single footholdchapter thirteentheres a spider here in this corner in that her three eyes tiptoe in darkness her eight legs track my spine she mirrors and mocks my pacingtheres a spider here who knows all of me her web my history full writsomewhere in this strange place a spider waits for my panicked flightthe conspiracy blind gallan bsoon as the guild assassin left the room kalam drained the last of his beer paid up and ascended the staircasefrom the gallery railing he studied the crowd below then seeing that no one paid him much attention he strode down the hallway and entered the last room on the righthe closed the door and locked it quick ben was seated crosslegged on the floor within a circle of melted blue wax the wizard was hunched over barechested his eyes shut and droplets of sweat trickling down his face around him the air shimmered as if glossed with lacquerkalam walked around the wax circle to the bed he took a leather satchel from a peg above the bedpost and set it down on the thin strawfilled mattress peeling back the flap he removed the contents a minute later hed laid out the mechanisms for a goats foot arbalest the crossbows metal parts had been blued the narrow wooden stock soaked in pitch and dusted with black sand kalam slowly quietly assembled the weaponquick ben spoke behind him done whenever youre ready friendthe man left through the kitchen but hell be back kalam said rising with the arbalest in his hands he attached a strap to it and slung the weapon over one shoulder then he faced the wizard im readyquick ben also stood wiping his forehead with a sleeve two spells youll be able to float control every descent the other should give you the ability to see anything magicalwell almost anything if theres a high mage kicking around were out of luckand you kalam asked as he examined his quiver of boltsyou wont see me directly just my aura quick ben replied with a grin but ill be with you all the waywell hopefully thisll go smoothly we make contact with the guild we offer the empires contract they accept and remove for us every major threat in the city he shrugged into his black cloak and pulled up the hoodyou sure we cant just go downstairs and walk right up to the man lay it outkalam shook his head not how its done weve identified him hes done the same with us hes probably just made contact with his commander and theyll arrange things to their liking our man should lead us now to the meetwont it be an ambush were walking into thenthe large man agreed more or less but theyll want to know what we want with them first and once thats out i doubt the guilds master will be interested in killing us you readyquick ben raised a hand towards kalam then muttered briefly under his breathkalam felt a lightness come into him rising to his skin and emanating a cushion of cool air that enveloped his body and before his eyes quick bens figure formed a bluegreen penumbra concentrated at the wizards longfingered hands i have them the assassin said smiling two old friendsquick ben sighed yes here we are doing this all over again he met his friends gaze hoods on our heels kal i can feel his breath on my neck these daysyoure not alone in that kalam turned to the window sometimes he said drily i have the feeling our empire wants us dead he walked to the window unlatched the shutters then swung them inward and leaned both hands on the sillquick ben came up beside him and rested a hand on his shoulderthey gazed out at the darkness a brief sharing of unease passing between themweve seen too much quick ben said softlyhoods breath kalam growled what are we doing this for anywaymaybe if the empire gets what it wantsdarujhistantheyll let us slip awaysure but whos going to convince the sergeant to walk out of the empirewe show him he hasnt got any choicekalam climbed on to the sill good thing im not a claw any more just soldiers rightbehind him quick ben touched his own chest and vanished his disembodied voice held a note of wry amusement right no more cloakanddagger games for old kalamthe assassin pulled himself up turning to face the wall then beginning his climb to the roof yeah ive always hated itquick bens voice was beside him now no more assassinationsno more spying kalam added reaching for the roofs edgeno more disguising spellsclambering on to the roof kalam lay still no more daggers in the back he whispered then sat up and scanned the nearby rooftops he saw nothing no unusual huddled shapes no bright magical aurasthank the gods came quick bens whisper from abovethank the gods kalam echoed then looked down over the roofs edge below a pool of light marked the inn entrance you take the back door ive got this onerighteven as the wizard answered kalam stiffened there he is he hissedyou still with mequick ben assentedthey watched the figure of rallick nom now cloaked crossing to the far side of the street and entering an alleyim on him quick ben saida bluegreen glow rose around the wizard he rose into the air and flew out swiftly across the street slowing as he reached the alley kalam climbed to his feet and padded silently along the roofs edge reaching the corner he glanced down to the rooftop of an adjacent building then jumpedhe descended slowly as if sinking through water and landed without a sound off to his right moving on a parallel path was quick bens magical aura kalam crossed the rooftop to the next building their man was heading for the harbourfrontkalam continued tracking quick bens beacon moving from one rooftop to the next sometimes jumping down at other times climbingthere was little subtlety about kalam where others used finesse he used the strength of his thick arms and legs it made him an unlikely assassin but hed learned to use that to his advantagethey now approached the harbour area the buildings singlestoreyed and large the streets rarely lit except around the doubledoor entrances to warehouses where the occasional private guard lingered in the night air hung the taint of sewage and fishfinally quick ben stopped hovered over a warehouse courtyard then hurried back to kalam who waited at the edge of a nearby twostoreyed clearing house looks like the place quick ben said floating a few feet above kalam what nowi want a good line of sight to that courtyardfollow mequick ben led him to another building their man was now visible crouching on the warehouse roof attention down on the courtyard belowkai do you smell something bad about thiskalam snorted hell no its bloody roses out here take position friendrightrallick nom lay down on the rooftop his head out over its edge below was the warehouses courtyard flat grey and empty directly beneath him the shadows were impenetrable sweat trickled down rallicks facefrom the shadow below came ocelots voice hes got you in sightyesand hes not movingno listen im sure theres more than one of them i wouldve known if hed been trailing me and no one was it stinks of magery ocelot and you know what i think about magerydammit nom if youd just start using the stuff we give you youd rank among the best of us but to hoods gate with that weve got spotters and unless theres a very good wizard around wed pick up on any magic face it a note of malice entered ocelots voice hes better than you he tracked you all right solowhat now rallick askedocelot chuckled were closing the circle even as we speak your works done nom tonight the assassins war ends in five minutes you can head homehigh above the city a demon flapped on leathery wings its green reptilian eyes surveying the rooftops below with a vision that detected magic as easily as it did heat though the demon was no larger than a dog its power was immense near par to the man who had summoned and chained it this very night on the rooftops it saw two auras close together one a man on whom spells had been cast and the other a wizard a very good wizard in a ragged circle on other rooftops around these two men and women moved inward some betrayed by the heat of their bodies others by items imbued with sorceryuntil now the demon rode the high night winds bored and resentful of its master a mere mission of observation for one of such power but now the demon felt a surge of bloodlust if only its master had been weaker so that it could break the bonds and descend to the rooftops then there would have been slaughterthe demon was musing on these thoughts its eyes fixed on the scene below when a booted heel rammed into the back of its small round head the creature spun tumbling then twisted round to face its attacker rage blazing in its skulla moment later it was fighting for its life the figure that closed with the demon possessed a blinding magical aura grappling the surging energies of both collided enwrapped like tentacles the demon struggled against the savage pain constricting it as the figure pressed its attack a cold that burned filled the demons skull a cold alien in its breath of power so alien that the demon could find no means of countering itthe two fell slowly as they fought duelling in absolute silence with forces invisible to the citys inhabitants below while around them other figures descended towards the warehouse cloaks spread like sails crossbows crooked in their arms hooded faces angled downward and hidden beneath black masks there were eleven in all that passed the demon and its attacker none of the others paid any attention and with this realization the demon experienced an emotion it had never known before fearits thoughts turning from battle to survival the demon tore itself from its attackers grasp loosing a highpitched cry it flapped upwardthe figure did not pursue instead joining the others in their silent descent to the cityas the twelve shrouded assassins dropped towards the circle of men and women below one splitting off and angling above the circles two targets they took careful aim with their crossbows and began a massacrekalam stared down at the assassin lying supine on the roof below wondering what to do next were they waiting for him to initiate contact a low growl escaped him something was wrong he could feel it like fever in his bonesdammit quick lets get out of herewait came quick bens disembodied voice oh damn he said softly then in front of kalam two brightly glowing shapes dropped down on to the roof below landing behind their markwhat the hellthen he felt a slight tremor on the flat tiles beneath his hands kalam rolled on to his back hearing a quarrel whiz past framed by his knees a cloaked figure stood about thirty feet away after missing with the quarrel the figure raced forward another landed behind the first one near the roofs far edgekalam scampered he dropped down over the roofs edgequick ben floated above him the spell of deflection hed raised about himself was a high order magery and he was certain he remained unseen by these new assailants he watched as the approaching figure slowed then padded cautiously to the roof edge where kalam had dropped from sight daggers gleaming in both gloved hands this new assassin reached the edge and crouched quick ben held his breath as the figure leaned forwardkalam hadnt gone far he gripped the roofs gables when the attackers upper body came into view blotting out the stars behind it he surged upward on the strength of one arm his other shooting up to close on the assassins neck with a vicelike grip kalam jerked the assassin downward at the same time bringing up his knee the attackers clothwrapped face met his knee with a crunch kalam still gripping the gable with one hand gave the now limp figure a shake then sent the body spiralling down to the street belowgasping he pulled himself back on to the roof at the far end he saw the second assassin whirl around growling kalam surged to his feet and sprinted at the figurethe unknown assassin stepped back as if startled then brought a hand down and promptly vanishedkalam slid to a stop and stood crouched both hands hanging at his sidesi see her quick ben whisperedwith a hiss kalam spun in a full circle then danced to one side putting his back to the roofs edge i dontshes putting energy into it quick ben said i keep losing her wait kai the wizard fell silentkalams head snapped with every muted sound his breath gusted in and out from his nostrils his hands twitched wait a low rumble came from his chest wait for what a knife in his throatall at once the night exploded with sound and fire the attacker burst into view immediately in front of kalam dagger flashing at his chestsmoke and sparks rained from her but she moved as if unaffected kalam twisted to one side trying to avoid the blade the dagger tore through his shirt below his ribs sinking deep into his flesh then ripping sidewayshe felt a hot gush of blood as he drove a fist into the womans solar plexus she gasped reeling back threads of blood whipping from the dagger in her right hand kalam charged forward with a snarl he closed and ignoring the assassins dagger punched into her chest again ribs cracked his other hand flatpalmed her forehead the assassin sprawled backwards landing with a thump on the roof her body stilledkalam sank to one knee drawing in gulps of air wait you said daminit what the hells wrong with you quick he pushed a knot of cloth into the wound below his ribcage quickthere was no reply he tensed then turned and scanned the lower rooftops bodies lay scattered here and there the warehouse roof where hed seen two figures land behind their mark was empty groaning softly he sank down on to his kneeswith the womans attack hed heard something amid the flashing fires a boom no two booms very close together an exchange of magic his breath caught was there a third assassin a wizard quick ben had damaged this one but someone else had damaged quick ben oh hood he whispered glaring aboutrallicks first intimation of trouble was a sharp blow between his shoulder blades the breath burst from his lungs carrying with it the ability to move his back throbbed and he knew hed been hit by a quarrel but the jazeraint armour under his shirt had withstood the impactthe quarrels spiked head had pierced the iron but had been too spent to push further through the thumping pulse in his ears he caught a pair of footsteps approaching him from behindfrom the shadows below came ocelots voice nom whats happeningbehind rallick the footsteps stopped and there came the soft clacking of a crossbow being cocked rafficks wind returned the numbness receding from his body his own weapon lay beside him ready he waitednoma soft footfall sounded behind him and to the left in one motion rallick rolled on to his back grasped his crossbow sat up and fired the assassin less than fifteen feet away was thrown back by the quarrels impact its weapon flyingrallick heaved himself to one side only now seeing the second attacker well behind the first the figure crouched and fired its crossbowthe quarrel caught rallicks upper chest on the right then ricocheted up past his head to disappear into the darkness the blow left his right arm numb he struggled to his feet unsheathing his knife the hooked blade a blue flicker in the nightthe assassin opposite him took a careful step forward then backed away to the far edge and dropped over the sidehoods breath came ocelots voice beside rallick he turned but saw no onehe saw my magic ocelot said good work on the first one nom maybe we can finally determine who these people arei dont think so rallick said his eyes on the motionless body an incandescent shimmer now wreathed itas the body disappeared ocelot cursed some kind of recall spell he said suddenly the clan master appeared in front of rallick his face twisted into a snarl as he glared about we set the trap we end up deadrallick did not reply he reached over his shoulder pulled out the quarrel and tossed it to one side the trappers had become the trapped that was true but he felt certain that the man whod followed him had nothing to do with these newcomers he turned and gazed up at the roof where his follower had been stationed even as he watched there was a flash of red and yellow light and a double thunderclap and in that instant rallick saw a silhouetted figure at the roofs edge defending itself from a frontal attack the flash winked out leaving only darknessmagery ocelot whispered highpower stuff too come on were getting out of herethey left quickly climbing down into the warehouse courtonce she had marked them sorry could find the fat little man and the coin bearer effortlessly though shed intended to trail this kruppe after leaving kalam and quick ben in the hut something had drawn her instead to the boy a suspicion a sense that his actions wereat least for nowmore important than kruppes meanderingsthe coin bearer was the last of oponns influence and the gods most vital player in the game thus far shed done well in eliminating the other potential playersmen like captain paran who had been the adjuncts aide and by extension a servant to the empress and there had been that claw leader in pale the one she had garotted on her path to the bridgeburners others had been removed as well but only as necessaryshe knew that the boy would have to die yet something within her seemed to be fighting that conclusion and it was a part of her she could not recognize shed been taken born a killer two years ago on a coastal road the body she dwelt within was convenient suitably unmarred by the events of a dramatic lifea young girls body a young girl whose mind was no match for the power that overwhelmed it obliterated itbut was it obliterated what had the coin touched inside her and whose voice was this that spoke with such power and determination in her head it had come upon her before when whiskeyjack had uttered the word seershe tried hard to remember any dealings she might have had with a seer in the last two years but none came to mindshe pulled her cloak tighter about her shoulders finding the boy had been easy but as to what he was up to that was another matter on the surface it looked no more complicated than a simple theft crokus had stood in an alley studying a lighted window on the third floor of an estate waiting until the light went out wrapped in unnatural shadows as she was he had not seen her as he scaled the slick wall she leaned against he climbed with impressive grace and skillafter hed gone she found another vantagepoint which allowed her full view of the rooms balcony and sliding doors this had meant entering the estates garden but there had been only one guard patrolling the grounds shed killed him effortlessly and now stood beneath a tree with her eyes on the balconycrokus had already reached it had picked the lock and entered the room beyond he was quite good she had to admit but what thief would then spend close to half an hour in the chamber he was robbing half an hour and still counting shed heard no alarms seen no lights spring to life behind any of the estates other windows nothing to indicate that anything had gone wrong so what was crokus doing in theresorry stiffened sorcery had burgeoned in another part of darujhistan and its flavour was known to her she hesitated unable to decide leave the lad and investigate this new deadly emanation or remain here until crokus reemerged or was discoveredthen she saw something behind the balconys sliding doors that ended her indecisionsweat ran down crokuss face and he found he had repeatedly to wipe it from his eyes hed beaten the new triggers to get insidethe one on the balcony the tripwire at the latchand now padded to the makeup table once there he froze unable to move idiot what am i doing herehe listened to her soft regular breathing behind himlike the breath of a dragonhe was certain he could feel it gusting against the back of his neck crokus looked up and scowled at his own reflection in the mirror what was happening to him if he didnt leave soon he began to remove his bags contents when hed finished he glanced again at his own faceto see another behind it a round white face watching him from the bedthe girl spoke since youre putting it all back id prefer the proper arrangement my makeup jar goes to the left of the mirror she said in a whisper the hairbrush goes to the right have you my earrings as well just leave them on the dressercrokus groaned hed even forgotten to cover his face dont try anything he growled ive returned everything and now ill leave understandthe girl pulled her blankets about her and moved to the beds endthreats wont work thief she said all i need do is scream and my fathers master guardsman will be here in seconds would you cross your dagger with his shortswordno said crokus id put it to your throat instead with you as a hostage with you between me and the guard will he swing his blade at me unlikelythe girl paled as a thief youd lose a hand but kidnapping a highborn itd be the high gallows for youcrokus tried to shrug casually he glanced at the balcony gauging how fast he could be outside and then up on the roof that new tripwire was a nuisancestay where you are the girl commanded im lighting a lanternwhy crokus demanded fidgetingto see you better she replied and light bloomed in the room from the lantern in her laphe scowled he hadnt noticed it there so close at hand she was ruining his plans even as he made them whats the point in seeing me better he snarled just call your damn guards and have me arrested be done with it he pulled the silk turban from his shirt and dropped it on the tabletop thats all of it he saidthe girl glanced at the turban and shrugged easily that was to be part of my costume for the fte she said ive since found a nicer onewhat he hissed do you want with mefear showed momentarily on her face at his desperate outburst then she smiled i wish to know why a thief who succeeded in stealing all my jewels should now be returning them that isnt something thieves usually dowith good reason he muttered more to himself than to her he stepped forward then stopped as she jerked back on to her bed her eyes widening crokus raised a hand sorry didnt mean to frighten you only i want to see you better thats allwhyhe was at a loss for an answer to that after all he couldnt very well tell her hed fallen madly in love with her whats your name he blurtedchallice darle whats yourschallice of course he said rolling his eyes you would be named something like that he glared at her my name none of your business thieves dont introduce themselves to their victimsher eyebrows rose victim but im no longer a victim am i youve settled that by returning id think she said slyly youre more or less obliged to tell me your name considering what youre doing and you must be the type who treats obligations seriously no matter how strange they seemcrokus frowned at that what was she talking about what did she know about how he looked at obligations and why was she right my name he sighed defeated is crokus younghand and youre the daughter of the high born darle who all those suitors are lining up to be introduced to but one day youll see me in that line challice and only you will know where you last saw me itll be a formal introduction and ill bring a gift as is correct he stared at her horrified by his own wordsher wide eyes held his emotion bright in thememotion hed no hope of understandingthen she burst out laughing she immediately clapped a hand over her mouth then jolted forward on the bed youd better go crokus someone will have heard me quickly and beware the tripwirecrokus moved woodenly to the balconys sliding doors her laughter had been the final punctuation to all his dreams he felt dead inside except for a cynics chuckle that might have been his own given the odd look she threw him her blankets had fallen down around her and once again she was naked it astonished him in a distant way that she hadnt even seemed to noticea voice came from beyond the door leading to the hallway indistinctthe girl hissed hurry you fool alarm bells jangled in his head awakening him he had to move and fast crokus stepped over the tripwire and opened the door he paused to glance back at her and smiled as she clutched the blankets to her neckwell at least hed won that mucha knock sounded on the opposite doorcrokus emerged on to the balcony and hitched himself up on to the railing he looked down into the garden and almost fell the guard was gone in his place stood a womanand though she was cloaked something about her triggered instant recognition the woman from the bar and she was looking right at him with dark eyes that burned him deep insidethe door in the room opened and crokus shook himself damn that woman anyway damn both of them he grasped the eaves above his head and swung lithely up and out of sightkalam crouched motionless in the middle of the rooftop a knife in each hand around him was silence the night air tense and heavy long minutes passed at times he convinced himself he was alone that quick ben and the other wizard had left the roof that they hunted each other in the sky overhead or in the alleys and streets below or on another roof but then hed hear something a drawn breath a scuff of cloth against leather or a wisp of wind would brush his cheek on this windless nightthen before his eyes the darkness was shattered two shapes appeared hovering over the rooftop the assassin had found quick ben attacking with a bolt of fire that seemed to stun the wizard then swiftly closing the distance between himself and the dazed mankalam surged forward to intercept quick ben vanished then reappeared immediately behind the assassin the blue flash of power bursting from the wizards hands struck the magicwielding assassin full in the back clothes aflame the man tumbled through the airquick ben whirled to kalam come on get movingkalam ran his friend flying beside him as they reached the roofs edge he turned for a last look the assassin mage had somehow snuffed the fire from his clothes and was regaining his balance at the far edge two of his comrades appearedjump quick ben said ill stall themwith what kalam demanded tottering on the edgein answer quick ben produced a small vial he spun in the air and hurled itkalam cursed then jumpedthe vial struck the rooftop and shattered with a thin tinkle beyond the three assassins paused quick ben remained his eyes on the white smoke rising from the glass shards a figure took form within the smoke growing in size its shape was almost insubstantial the smoke stretching like threads in places curling like wool in others all that was visible within it was its eyes two black slits which it swung to quick benyou it said its voice that of a child are not master tayschrennthats right quick ben said but im in his legion your service remains with the empire he pointed across the roof there are three who are the empires enemies demon tiste and here to oppose the malazan empiremy name is pearl the korvalah demon said softly then turned to the three assassins who had spread out along the far edge they are not fleeing pearl said with a note of surprisequick ben wiped sweat from his forehead he glanced down kalam was a vague shape waiting in the alley below i know he said to pearlthat observation had unnerved him as well one of tayschrenns korvalahrai could level a city if it so chosethey accept my challenge pearl said facing quick ben again should i pity themno he answered just kill them and be done with itthen i return to master tayschrennyeswhat is your name wizardhe hesitated then said ben adaephon delatyou are supposed to be dead pearl said your name is so marked on the scrolls of those high mages who fell to the empire in seven citiesquick ben glanced up others are coming pearl you are in for a fightthe demon lifted its gaze above them glowing figures descended five in the first wave one in the second this last one radiated such power that quick ben shrank back his blood chilled the figure had something long and narrow strapped to its backben adaephon delat pearl said plaintively see the last who comes you send me to my deathi know quick ben whisperedflee then i will hold them enough to ensure your escape no morequick ben sank down past the roofbefore he passed from sight pearl spoke again ben adaephon delat do you pity meyes he replied softly then pivoted and dropped down into darknessraffick walked down the centre of the street on either side of the wide corridor rose columns from which gas torches jutted casting circles of blue light on to the wet cobblestones the light rain had returned coating i everything in a slick sheen to his right and beyond the resident houses lining that side of the street the pale domes of the high thalanti on the hill glistened against the deep grey skythe temple was among the oldest structures in the city its founding blocks over two thousand years old the thalanti monks had come like so many others carried on the wings of the rumour rallick knew less about the story than did murillio and coll one of the elder peoples was believed to have been entombed among the hills an individual of great wealth and power that was the extent of his knowledgebut it had been a rumour with many consequences if not for the thousands of shafts sunk into the earth the caverns of gas would never have been found and while many of those shafts had collapsed or had been forgotten over the centuries still others remained now connected by tunnelsin one of the many chambers that honeycombed the ground beneath the temple waited vorcan master of assassins rallick imagined ocelot making his descent burdened with the news of disaster and it brought a smile to his lean face hed never met vorcan but ocelot suited those catacombsjust another of the citys rats rushing about beneath his feetone day rallick knew hed become a clan leader hed meet vorcan face to face somewhere below he wondered at how it would change him and travelling down this path soured his thoughts with displeasurehe had no option once he thought as he approached the block of the phoenix inn long ago thered been choices he could have made that would have sent him on a different path but those days were dead and the future held only nights a stretch of darkness that led down to the eternal dark he would meet vorcan eventually and hed swear his life to the guild master and that would be that the closing of the final doorand his sense of outrage at the injustices around him the corruptions of the world would wither in the unlit tunnels beneath darujhistan in the exactness of the methods of assassination his final victim would be himselfand this more than anything made his and murillios scheme the last act of humanity hed ever make betrayal was the greatest of all crimes in rallicks mind for it took all that was human within a person and made it a thing of pain in the face of that murder itself was surcease it was quick and it ended the anguish and despair of a life without hopeif all went as planned lady sinital and those men whod conspired with her in the betrayal of her husband lord coll would die could that right the wrong could it even the scales of retribution no but it might return to a man his life and his hopefor himself rallick such gifts had long since been lost and he was not the kind of man to stir the ashes no embers survived no flame could be born anew life belonged to other people and his only claim to it was his power to take it from them nor would he recognize hope if it came to him too much a stranger too long a ghostas he neared the inns entrance rallick saw crokus approaching from down the street he increased his pace crokus he calledthe boy flinched then seeing rallick he stopped and waitedrallick took his arm and steered him towards the alley without saying a word once in the shadows he tightened his grip swung crokus round and pulled him close listen to me he hissed his face inches from the boys own astonished visage the guilds best were slaughtered tonight this isnt a game you stay off the rooftops do you understand mecrokus noddedand tell your uncle this theres a claw in the citythe boys eyes widenedand rallick continued theres someone else someone coming down from the sky killing everything in sightuncle mammotjust tell him and now listen carefully crokus what im about to say is from me to you one to one understandcrokus nodded again his face paleyou stay on this path and youll end up dead i dont give a damn how exciting it all seemswhats excitement to you is desperation to others stop feeding off the citys lifeblood lad theres no heros role in sucking others dry am i understoodyes crokus whisperedrallick released the boys arm and stepped back now leave he shoved crokus up the street watched the boy stagger away and disappear around a corner he drew a deep breath surprised to find his hands trembling as he loosened his cloaks collarmurillio stepped from the shadows im not sure itll work friend but it was a good try he laid a hand on the assassins shoulder master baruk has a job for us kruppe insists we bring crokus alongrallick frowned along are we leaving darujhistan thenafraid sogo without me rallick said tell baruk i cant be found everythings at a critical junctureour planning includedsomething else happening nomyou heard the message i gave crokus for his unclemurillio shook his head i came late to your scene saw you dragging the lad into the alleywell rallick said lets go inside its been a night to make hood smile friendtogether the two men strode from the alley in the street outside the phoenix inn dawns light crept through the mists of the lingering rainin the centre of the rooftop lay a large patch of ash and bone that crackled faintly and cast out the occasional hissing spark anomander rake slammed his sword into its sheath i sent

lord we were hard pressed in broods campaign were in need of rest mistakes were made this night some of the guild slipped through our fingers and had you not answered my request we would have suffered

time as one the eight tiste and raised their hands then vanishedrake glanced down at the sizzling patch just as it ate through the roof and fell into darkness there came a faint crash from below lord anomander rake swung his gaze back to the sky then sighedsergeant whiskeyjack rocked his chair on to its back two legs and anchored it against the crumbling wall the small dingy room reeked of urine and damp two single beds woodframed with burlap mattresses stuffed with straw ran along the wall to his left the three other rickety chairs had been pulled up around the lone table in the rooms centreabove the table hung an oil lantern which shone down on fiddler hedge and mallet as they sat playing cardstheyd done their work finishing with the coming of dusk just outside majesty hall until the alliance with the moranth the malazan saboteur had been nothing more than a glorified sapper a digger of tunnels and breaker of city gates moranth alchemy had introduced to the empire a variety of chemical and powder explosives most of which detonated when exposed to air applying a slowworking acid wormholed the unfired clay shells sabotage had become an art the precise equation of clay thickness and acid strength was tricky and few survived to learn from their mistakesto whiskeyjacks mind hedge and fiddler were terrible soldiers he had trouble recalling the last time theyd unsheathed their shortswordswhatever discipline that had been part of their basic training had disintegrated through years in the field still when it came to sabotage they had no equalsthrough hooded eyes whiskeyjack studied the three men sitting at the table it had been some minutes since any of them had made a move or said a word one of fiddlers new games he decided the man was forever inventing new ones improvising the rules whenever they gave him an edgedespite the endless arguments fiddler was never short of playersand thats what boredom can do he said to himself but no it was more than just boredom waiting gnawed especially when it had to do with friends quick ben and kalam might be face down in some alley for all they knew and that made it hardwhiskeyjacks gaze strayed to one of the beds on which lay his armour and longsword rust stained the hauberks tattered chain like old blood the links were missing in some places torn in others in his bones and muscles the memory of that damage remained every cut every blow now haunted him with aches greeting him each morning like old comrades the sword with its plain leatherwrapped grip and stub hilt lay in its hideoverwood scabbard the belt and straps draped over the bedsidethat weapon had come to him after his first battle found amid a field of dead hed still had the chalk of his fathers quarry on his boots then and a worlds promise stretched out before him on the banners of empire the sword had come to him shiny without even so much as a nick in its honed blade and he had taken it as his own personal standardwhiskeyjacks gaze lost its focus his mind had stepped into the grey muddy tracks of his youth where he walked the familiar path lost and blinded by an unidentifiable sorrowthe door flew open carrying into the room a gust of steamy air and then trotts the barghasts coaldark eyes met the sergeantswhiskeyjack stood quickly he went to the bed and retrieved his sword at the table the others remained intent on their card game their only betrayal of anxiety a subtle shifting of chairs whiskeyjack pushed past trotts and closed the door to a crack through which he lookedacross the street at the mouth of an alley two figures crouched the larger leaning heavily against the other whiskeyjacks breath hissed through his teeth mallet he said over his shoulderat the table the healer frowned at the two saboteurs then carefully set down his cardsthe two figures in the alley crossed the street whiskeyjacks hand crept to grip his swordwhich mallet asked as he rearranged the blankets on one of the bedskalam the sergeant replied the two men reached the door and he swung it wide to let them through then shut it again he beckoned at trotts who walked over to the curtained window pulling back a corner to watch the streetkalam was pale sagging against quick ben the assassins dark grey m ir shirt was soaked with blood mallet moved to help the wizard and together they carried kalam to the bed as soon as the heater had him laid out he waved quick ben away and began removing kalams shirtquick ben shook his head at whiskeyjack and sat down in the chair mallet had occupied whats the game he asked picking up mallets cards and frowning as he studied themneither hedge nor fiddler repliedno idea whiskeyjack said as he walked over to stand behind mallet they just sit and starequick ben grinned ah a waiting game right fid he leaned back comfortably and stretched out his legsmallet glanced up at the sergeant hell be down for a while the healer said the wound is clean but hes lost a lot of bloodcrouching whiskeyjack studied the assassins pallid face kalams gaze remained sharp focused on the sergeant well whiskeyjack demanded what happenedquick ben answered behind him had a bit of a mage duel out therekalam nodded in confirmationand whiskeyjack asked straightening to glare at the wizardquick ben wilted slightly in his chair it went sour i had to release an empire demon to get us out aliveeveryone in the room went still at the window trotts turned and made a tribal warding gesture tracing the woad lines on his facewhiskeyjacks voice was soft its loose in the cityno the wizard answered its deadwho did you run into whiskeyjack bellowed throwing up his handsnot sure exactly quick ben said quietly whatever it was it took care of the demon in less than a minute i heard the death cry when were only a block away assassin mages sergeant coming down out the sky seemed intent on wiping out the citys guildwhiskeyjack returned to his chair and dropped into it the wood col plaining beneath him from the sky tiste andyes quick ben muttered we thought that the sorcery had a flavour old dark and icy cold kurald galainfrom what we saw kalam added they did a damn good job i contact established sergeant it was messy up thereso the moons active here whiskeyjack paused then pounded his on the chairs arm worse the moons lord is a move ahead of us we reckoned wed try to contact the guild so what does he dotakes out the guild kalam said hows that for arrogancewhatever arrogance that lord has whiskeyjack said grimacing he earned it ill give him that i wonder how good this citys guild master isgood enough to take on tiste and unlikelyand about the other thing quick ben said it workedthe sergeant stared at the wizard for half a dozen seconds then noddedwe also ran into sorry kalam said wincing as mallet pressed a hand on his wound the healer muttered under his breathoh i sent her after some fat man she thought was important how come she ran into you twoquick bens brows had risen so she told the truth then we dont know how she found us but shed found the man we were looking forand gave him to usmallet raised his hand where the wound had been there was now a pink scar kalam grunted his thanks and sat upwhiskeyjack tapped his fingers against the chairs arm if we only knew who was running this damn city we could try it ourselvesthe assassin sniffed if we start taking out council members maybe well flush out the real rulersthe sergeant frowned not bad he said rising to his feet work on that the moons lord knows were here now with that demon popping up well have to move fastfiddler spoke up we could blow up majesty hall he said smirking at hedgeyouve got enough munitions to manage that whiskeyjack askedfiddlers face fell well uh weve got enough to take out an estate maybe but if we pull up some of the mines we plantedwhiskeyjack sighed this is getting absurd no we leave things as they are he watched the nonexistent card game it seemed to involve complete immobility a standoff the sergeants eyes narrowed were they trying to tell him somethingorange and yellow hues lit the eastern horizon casting a coppery sheen upon the citys bricks and cobbles apart from the dripping of water the streets were quiet though the first emergings of citizenry were minutes away soon those farmers who had depleted their supplies of grains fruits and root crops would take to their carts and wagons and depart the city merchant shops and stalls would open to catch the morning wave of shoppersthroughout darujhistan the greyfaces prepared to shut the valves feeding gas to the torches lining the major avenues these figures moved in small groups gathering at intersections then dispersing with the days first bellsorry watched crokus wearily ascend a tenements front steps she stood half a block down the street within shadows that seemed reluctant to disappear despite the growing lighta short while earlier shed felt the empire demons death strike her almost physically deep in her chest normally demons fled back to their realm once enough damage had been inflicted on them enough to sever the links of summoning but the korvalah had not been simply cut down or forcibly dismissed thered been a finality to its end that had left her shaken a death in truth she still recalled its silent despairing scream ringing in her headall the ambivalence surrounding the coin bearer was gone driven away she knew now she would kill him it had to be done and soon all that remained before she could do so was the mystery of his actions to what extent was oponn using the boyshe knew hed seen her in the darles garden just before hed escaped to the estates roof seeing the light come on behind the balconys sliding doors had clinched her decision to continue following crokus the darle family was powerful in darujhistan that the boy seemed to be involved in a clandestine love affair with the daughter was an outrageous proposition yet what else could she conclude so the question remained was opornn working through the boy directly insinuating a peculiar influence with the city council what powers of influence did this young maiden possessonly a matter of position of possible scandal yet what was the political position of councilman estraysian darle sorry realized that even though shed learned much of darujhistans political arena she still did not know enough to secondguess oponns moves councilman darle was turban orrs principal opposition on this proclamationofneutrality businessbut what did that matter the malazan empire could not care less unless the proclamation was no more than a feintwas this turban orr seeking to lay the groundwork for an empirebacked coupthe answers to such questions would be slow in coming she knew shed have to exercise patience of course patience was her finest quality shed hoped that showing herself to crokus a second time there in the garden might trigger panic in the lador at the very least annoy oponn if indeed the gods control was as direct as thatsorry had watched on from the shadows she drew around her as the assassin named rallick took the lad to task shed also lingered to catch the conversation between rallick and murillio it seemed the boy had protectors and an odd lot they were assuming that the fat little man kruppe was some kind of group leader hearing that they were to take crokus out of the city on behalf of their master made the whole situation even more intriguingshe knew shed have to make her move soon the protection offered by kruppe and this murillio would not impede her much she expected though kruppe was certainly more than he seemed violence hardly seemed his major skillshe would kill crokus then outside the city as soon as she discovered the nature of their mission and who their master was as soon as everything had fallen into placesergeant whiskeyjack would have to wait a while longer for her return sorry smiled at that knowing full well how relieved the whole squad would be that she was nowhere to be seen as for that whole matterthe threat presented by quick ben and kalamwell everything in its own timealchemist baruks savage migraine was ebbing whatever presence had been unleashed in the city was gone he sat in his reading chair pressing a clothwrapped chunk of ice against his forehead it had been a conjuring he felt certain of that the emanations stank of demonry but thered been more the moment before the presence vanished baruk had experienced a mental wrench that came close to driving him into unconsciousnesshed shared the creatures final death scream his own shriek echoing down the hall and bringing his menatarms shouting to his bedroom doorbaruk felt a wrongness deep within him as if his soul had been battered for a single brief second hed looked upon a world of absolute darkness and from that darkness came sounds the creak of wooden wheels the clank of chains the groans of a thousand imprisoned soulsthen it was gone and he found himself sitting in his chair roald kneeling at his side with a pail of ice from the cellarhe now sat in his study alone and the ice pressed against his brow was warm compared to what he felt in his heartthere was a knock at the door and roald entered his face creased with worry lord you have a visitori have at this hour he rose shakily to his feet who is itlord anomander rake roald hesitated and anotherfrowning baruk waved a hand bring them inyes lordrake entered holding a dogsized winged creature by the nape of its neck the creature twisted and hissed then turned pleading eyes to barukthis thing was following me here rake said yoursstartled baruk managed a nodi thought as much rake said releasing the demon to flap across the room and land at the alchemists slippered feetbaruk gazed down on it the demon was tremblingrake strode to a chair and sat stretching out his long legs a busy night he saidbaruk gestured and the demon vanished with a faint popping soundindeed he said his voice hard my servant was on a mission i had no idea it would involve you he went to stand before the tiste and why were you in the middle of an assassin warwhy not rake answered i started itwhathe smiled up at baruk you dont know the empress as well as i do barukplease explain colour had risen in the alchemists facerake looked away tell me this baruk he said turning to meet the alchemists gaze who in this city is most likely to be aware of your secret council and who might benefit the most from your removal and most importantly who in this city is capable of killing youbaruk did not answer immediately he walked slowly to the table where a newly painted map had been laid out he leaned over it hands resting on the edge you suspect the empress might seek out vorcan he said a contract to offeron you and the rest of the high mages rake said behind him the empress has sent a claw here not so much to worry your citys defencc but to establish contact with the master assassin i wasnt entirely certain that i was right in this but i meant to prevent that contactbaruks eyes remained on the maps red wash so you sent your own assassins to wipe out her guild to flush her out he faced rake and then what kill her all on the basis of some suspicion of yoursthis night rake said calmly we prevented the claw from making that contact your demons report will confirm this besides you are suggesting that the death of vorcan and the decimation of the city assassins is a bad thing are youi fear i am baruk was pacing struggling against a growing sense outrage i may not know the empress as well as you rake he said gritting his teeth but i do know this cityfar better than you ever willhe glared at the tiste and to you darujhistan is just another battle ground for your private war with the empress you dont give a damm about how this city surviveshow it has managed to survive three thousand yearsrake shrugged enlighten methe city council has its function a vital one they are the amp machine true majesty hall is a place of pettiness corruption endless bickering but despite all that its also a place where things get donewhats that got to do with vorcan and her gang of killersbaruk grimaced like any burdened wagon the wheels require greasewithout the option of assassination the noble families would have long since destroyed themselves taking the city with them through civil warsecondly the guilds efficiency provides a measure of control on vendettas arguments and so forth it is the guaranteed option of bloodshed and bloodshed is messy usually too messy for the nobilitys sensibilitiescurious rake said nevertheless dont you think that vorcan would listen very carefully indeed to an offer from the empress after all laseen has the precedent of handing over the rule of a conquered city to an assassin in fact at least a third of her present high fists come from that professionyou are missing the point baruks face was dark you did not consult us and that cannot be toleratedyou havent answered me rake retorted in a voice quiet and coldwould vorcan take the contract could she manage it is she that good barukthe alchemist turned away i dont know thats my answer to all three questionsrake stared hard at baruk if you were indeed nothing more than an alchemist i might believe youbaruks smile was wry why would you think me anything butnow it was rakes turn to smile there are few who would argue with me without flinching i am unused to be addressed as an equalthere are many paths to ascendancy some more subtle than othersbaruk walked over to the mantel above the fireplace took a carafe then went to the shelf behind his desk and retrieved two crystal goblets shes a high mage we all have magical defences but against her he filled the goblets with winerake joined the alchemist he accepted the glass and raised it between them i apologize for not informing you in truth the thought hadnt crossed my mind as being especially important until tonight i was acting on a theory nothing more i didnt consider the ripples a grounded guild might causebaruk sipped his wine anomander rake tell me something there was a presence in our city tonighta conjuringone of tayschrenns korvalah demons rake answered released by a claw wizard he took a mouthful of the tart liquid let it roll for a moment then swallowed with satisfaction its gonegone baruk asked quietly whereout of tayschrenns reach rake said a tight smile on his lips out of anyones reachyour sword baruk said repressing a shiver as the memory of that closing vision returned to him the creak of wheels the clank of chains the groans of a thousand lost souls and darknessoh yes rake said refilling his goblet i received the two pale wizards heads as you promised i admire your efficiency baruk did they protestbaruk paled i explained to them the options he said quietly no they didnt protestrakes soft laugh chilled the blood in baruks veinsat the distant sound kruppe rose the small fire flickered steadily before him but its heat seemed less ah he sighed kruppes hands are near numb yet his ears are as sharp as ever listen to

the exhaustion and depression fading away the thought that she could allow herself to slip into carelessness so easily had left her shaken and that was not a feeling with which she was familiar she did not know how to deal with it and this kept her unbalanced not quite sure of her own efficacyas the gadrobi hills appeared first to the south and then to the west as well she sensed a desperate urgency to regain her confidence the mission approached a vital juncture success with the jaghut barrow would almost ensure success with everything elsesince this dawn shed ridden hard pushing to keep her schedule intact after travelling so slowly in the first few days both horses were in need of rest so she now walked ahead of them the reins tucked through her belt and beside her walked toolthough the imass spoke often at her prodding of many fascinating things he denied her efforts regarding matters important to the empire and to laseens continued power all seemed to return to the vows he had had taken at the last gathering for the imass something was coming to a head she wondered if it was somehow connected with freeing this jaghut tyrant and that was a disturbing thoughtstill she would not permit any ambivalence to threaten the mission in this she was laseens arm and it was directed not of lorns own accord but by the empress dujek and tayschrenn had well reminded her of that truth thus she played no role in all thisnot as the woman named lorn how could she be held responsible for anythingin my years among humans tool said beside her i have come to recollect the passing of emotions in body and expressions adjunct you have worn a frown the past two days is this significantno she snapped it isnt purging her thoughts of personal feelings had never been so difficult as it was nowwas this a lasting effect of oponns meddling perhaps tool could rid her of it tool she said what is significant as you put it is that i dont know enough about what were doing we are seeking a standing stone the barrows marker well assuming it can be found why was it not so long ago why could not three thousand years of hunting find this barrowwe will find the standing stone tool replied calmly it marks the barrow in truth but the barrow is not therethe adjunct scowled more riddles explainthe imass was silent for a minute then he said i am born of an elder warren adjunct known as tellann it is more than a source of magic it is also a timeare you suggesting that the barrow exists in a different time is that how you plan to reach itby using your tellann warrenno there is no parallel time any different from the one we know that time is gone past it is more a matter of flavour adjunct may i continuelorns mouth thinned into a straight linethe jaghut who entombed the tyrant were born of a different elder warren but the term elder is relative only to the existing warrens of this age the jaghut omtose phellack is not elder when compared to tellann they are the same of the same flavour do you understand thus far adjunctpatronizing bastard she muttered to herself yes toolthe imass nodded his bones creaking the barrow has not been found before precisely because it is omtose phellack it lies within a warren now lost to the world yet i am tellann my warren touches omtose phellack i can reach it adjunct any tlanimass could i was chosen because i am without a clan i am alone in every waywhy should that be important lorn asked her stomach twistingtool looked at her adjunct what we seek to accomplish is the freeing of a jaghut tyrant such a being should it escape our control or defy our predictions is capable of destroying this continent it can enslave all living upon it and it would do so if permitted if instead of me logros had selected a bone caster and if the tyrant was freed that bone caster would become enslaved a jaghut tyrant is dangerous alone a jaghut tyrant with an imass bone caster at its side is unstoppable they would challenge the gods and they would kill most of them also i am without a clan thus my enslavementshould that event befallwould not enslave blood kinlorn stared at the imass what were the empress and tayschrenn thinking of how could they hope to control this thing you are saying tool that youre expendableyes adjunctand so she realized am i what she asked will stop the tyrant how do we control itwe dont adjunct that is the gamble we takeand what does that meantool shrugged an audible lifting and dropping of bones beneath the rotted furs the lord of moons spawn adjunct he will have no choice but to intervenehes capable of stopping the tyrantyes adjunct he is although it will cost him dearly weaken him more he is capable of delivering the single punishment that a jaghut tyrant fears most a faint gleam of light rose in tools eye sockets as the imass stared at lorn enslavement adjunctlorn stopped in her tracks you mean the moons lord will have the tyrant working on his sideno adjunct the enslavement is by the lords hand but it is beyond him as well you see the empress knows who the lord is and what he possesseslorn nodded hes tiste and and a high magea rasp of laughter came from tool adjunct he is

adjunct is the goddess of the tiste anda few minutes later lorn found her voice the empress she said quietly knows how to pick her enemiesand then tool hit her with another stunning revelation i am sure the imass said the tiste and regret their coming to this worldthey came to this world from where how whythe tiste and were of kurald galain the warren of darkness kurald galain stood alone untouched the goddess their mother knew loneliness tool hesitated there is probably little truth in this story adjunctgo on lorn said quietly pleasein her loneliness the goddess sought something outside herself thus was born light her children the tiste and saw this as a betrayal they rejected her some hold they were cast out others that they departed their mothers embrace by choice while tiste and mages still use the warren of kurald galain they are no longer of it and some have embraced another warren that of starvald demelainthe first warrentool noddedwhose warren did starvald demelain belong toit was the home of dragons adjunctmurillio turned in his saddle and brought the mule to a halt on the dusty road he glanced ahead kruppe and crokus had already reached the worry crossroads he patted his brow with the soft satin of his burnous then looked back again coll leaned hunched over in his saddle losing the rest of his breakfastmurillio sighed it was a wonder to see the man sober but that hed insisted on accompanying them bordered on miraculous murillio wondered if coll suspected anything of rallicks plansbut no he wouldve brought a fist down on his and rallicks head in short order if hed so much as caught a hint of what they were doingit had been colls pride that had got him into his present mess and drink did nothing to diminish it to the contrary in fact coll had even donned his brigandine armour replete with arm and leg greaves a bastard sword hung at the large mans hip and with his mail coif and helmet he looked every inch a noble knight the only exception was the green tinge to his rounded face he was also the only one of them to have found a horse instead of these damned mules kruppe had scroungedcoll straightened in his saddle and smiled wanly at murillio then spurred his horse alongside they resumed the journey without a word nudging their mounts into a canter until theyd caught up with the othersas usual kruppe was pontificating no more than a handful of days assures kruppe wizened traveller of the wastes beyond glittering darujhistan no reason to be so glum lad consider this a mighty adventurecrokus looked to murillio and threw up his hands adventure i dont even know what were doing out here wont anybody tell me anything i cant believe i agreed to thismurillio grinned at the boy come now crokus how many times have you expressed curiosity about our constant travels outside the city well here we areall your questions are about to find answerscrokus hunched down in his saddle you told me you all worked as agents for some merchant what merchant i dont see any merchant and wheres our horses how come colls the only one with a horse how come nobody gave me a sword or something whyall right murillio laughed holding up a hand enough please we are agents for a merchant he explained but its rather unusual merchandise were acquiringa rather unusual merchant as well kruppe adds with a warm smile lad we are agents seeking information on behalf of our employer who is none other than high alchemist baruk crokus stared at kruppe baruk and he cant afford to give us horseskruppe cleared his throat ah yes well there was something of a misunderstanding between worthy honest kruppe and a conniving deceitful stabler none the less kruppe received full recompense thus saving our kind master eleven silver coinswhich hell never see murillio mutteredkruppe went on as for a sword lad what on earth for ignore blustery pallid coll there with all his sweaty trappings of war a mere affectation of his and murillios rapier is no more than an ornamental trifle though no doubt he would claim that the jewels and emeralds studding said items hilt are towards achieving fine balance or some such martial detail kruppe smiled beatifically at murillio nay lad the true masters at acquiring information need no such clumsy pieces of metal indeed we disdain themok crokus grumbled what kind of information are we looking for thenall that yon ravens overhead can see kruppe said waving a hand in the air other travellers other efforts within the gadrobi hills all grist for master baruks mill of news we observe without being observed we learn while remaining a mystery to all we ascend to thewill you shut up coll moaned who brought the waterskinssmiling murillio removed a clay jug webbed in twine from his saddlehorn and handed it to colla sponge kruppe said squeezed beneath the burden of armour see the man down our precious water see it immediately reappear salty and grimy on his weathered skin what yon poisons have leaked forth kruppe shudders at the thoughtcoll ignored him handing the jug to crokus buck up lad he said youre getting paid and damn well with luck therell be no trouble believe me in this kind of work excitement is the last thing were looking for still he glared at murillio id feel a whole lot better if rallick were with uscrokus bristled and im an unworthy standin right you think i dont know that coll you think  dont tell me what i think coll rumbled i never said you were a standin crokus youre a thief and those kinds of skill come in a lot handier than anything i could manage the same for murillioand as for kruppe well his talents extend no further than his stomach and whatever he wants jammed in it you and rallick share a lot more than you think and thats why youre the most qualified man herebarring the necessary brains of course kruppe said which is my true skillthough one such as coll would never understand such abilities alien as they are to himcoll leaned towards crokus youre wondering why im wearing all this armour he whispered loudly its because kruppes in charge when kruppes in charge i dont feel safe unless im prepared for war if it comes to that lad ill get us out alive he leaned back and stared straight ahead ive done it before right kruppeabsurd accusations kruppe sniffedso crokus said what are we supposed to be on the lookout forwell know it when we see it murillio said he nodded towards the hills rising to the east up therecrokus was silent for a time then his eyes narrowed the gadrobi hills are we looking for a rumour murilliomurillio stiffened but it was kruppe who replied indeed lad rumours upon rumours i applaud your cunning conclusion now where is that water jug kruppes thirst has become intensesorrys departure through jammits gate was casual unhurried tracking the coin bearer was simple and did not require that the boy remain within her range of vision she sensed crokus and kruppe in the company of two others on the road a league beyond worrytown they did not seem to be in any kind of rushwhatever mission they were on that it concerned the welfare of darujhistan was plain thinking on it sorry was sure that the men within that group were spies and in all likelihood able ones the dandy murillio could move through nobleborn circles with an ease coupled with a desirable coynessthe perfect combination for a spy rallick though he did not accompany them on this mission was the eyes and ears within the assassins guild thus covering another power basekruppes world was that of the thieves and lower classes whence rumours sprang to life like weeds in muddy soil the third man was clearly a military man no doubt serving as the groups sword armon a mundane level then an adequate group to protect the coin bearer though insufficient to prevent her killing himespecially with the assassin left behindyet something nagged within sorrys mind a vague suspicion that the group was heading into dangera danger that threatened her as wellonce beyond worrytown she picked up her pace as soon as she found herself alone on the road she opened her warren of shadow and slipped into its swift tracksthe adjunct could find nothing to set apart the hill they approached its grasscloaked summit was dwarfed by those around it a half dozen scraggly windtwisted scrub oaks climbed one side amid a scree of broken boulders the summit flattened out into a rough circle rock pushing through here and thereoverhead wheeled ravens so high as to be no more than specks against the muggy grey sky lorn watched tool striding ahead of her the imass choosing an unwavering path towards the hills base she slumped in her saddle feeling defeated by the world around her the midday heat sapped her strength and the sluggishness reached through to her thoughtsnot oponns doing she knew this was the pervasive dread clinging to the air the sense that what they were doing was wrong terribly wrongto fling this jaghut tyrant into the hands of the empires enemy to trust this tiste and anomander rake to destroy it yet at great cost to himselfthus opening the way for malazan sorceries in turn to kill the son of darknessnow seemed precipitous absurd in its ambitionstool came to the base of the hill and waited for the adjunct to arrivelorn saw at tools hidewrapped feet a grey rock jutting perhaps ten inches from the earthadjunct the imass said this is the barrow marker we seekshe raised an eyebrow theres hardly any soil cover here at all she said are you suggesting this standing stone has eroded down to its present sizethe stone has not eroded tool answered it has stood here since before the sheets of ice came to cover this land it stood here when the rhivi plain was an inland sea long before the waters withdrew to what i is now lake azur adjunct the stone is in fact taller than both of us combined and what you think to be bedrock is shalelorn was surprised at the hint of anger in tools voice she dismounted and set to hobbling the horses how long do we stay here thenuntil this evening passes with tomorrows dawn i will open the way adjunctfaintly from above came the cries of ravens lorn lifted her head and gazed at the specks wheeling high over them theyd been with them for days was that unusual she didnt know shrugging she unsaddled the horsesthe imass remained motionless his gaze seeming fixed on the stone markerlorn went about preparing her camp among the scrub oaks she found wood for a small cooking fire it was dry weathered and likely to yield little smoke though she did not anticipate company caution had become her habit before dusk arrived she found a nearby hill higher than those around it and ascended to its summit from this position she commanded a view that encompassed leagues on all sides the hills continued their roll southward sinking to steppes to the southeastdue east of them stretched catlin plain empty of life as far as she could seelorn turned to the north the forest they had travelled round a few days ago was still visible a dark line thickening as it swept westward to the tahlyn mountains she sat down and waited for night to fall it was then that shed be able to spot any campfireseven as night fell the heat remained oppressive lorn walked around the hills summit to stretch her legs she found evidence of past excavations scars that dug into the shale and evidence of the gadrobi herders remained from as far back as when they fashioned stone toolsagainst the south side of the hill the ground had been carved out not in search of a barrow but as a stone quarry it appeared that beneath the shale was flint chocolate brown sharpedged and crusted in white chalkcurious lorn investigated further scrambling down into the cavitystone flakes carpeted the pits base she crouched and picked up a piece of flint it was the tip of a spear point expertly shapedthe echo of this technology was found in tools chalcedony sword she needed no further proof of the imasss assertions humans had indeed come from them had indeed inherited a worldempire was a part of them a legacy flowing like blood through human muscle bone and brain but such a thing could easily be seen as a cursewere they destined one day to become human versions of the tlan imass was war all there was would they bow to it in immortal lorn sat down in the quarry and leaned against the chiselled weathered stone the imass had conducted a war of extermination lasting hundreds of thousands of years who or what had the jaghut beenaccording to tool theyd abandoned the concept of government and turned their backs on empires on armies on the cycles of rise and fall fire and rebirth theyd walked alone disdainful of their own kind dismissive of community of purposes greater than themselves they would not she realized have started a waroh laseen she murmured tears welling in her eyes i know why we fear this jaghut tyrant because he became human he became like us he enslaved he destroyed and he did it better than we could she lowered she fell silent then letting the tears roll down her cheeks seep betweer her fingers trickle along her wrists who wept from her eyes she wondered was it lorn or laseen or was it for our kind what did it matter such tears had been shed before and would be againby other like her and yet unlike her and the winds would dry them allcaptain paran glanced at his companion youve got a theory about al toc the younger scratched his scar damned if i know captain he stared down at the black burned crusted raven lying on the ground in front of them ive been counting though thats the eleventh roasted bird in the last three hours and unless theyre covering the rhivi plain like some bloody carpet it seems were on somebodys trail paran grunted then kicked his horse forwardtoc followed and its a nasty somebody he continued those ravens look like they was blasted from the inside out hell even the flies avoid toc squinted at the hills south of them theyd found a woodcutters trail through the tahlyn forest shaving days off their journey as soon as theyd returned to the rhivi traders track however theyd found the ravens and also the signs of two horses

times since the days beginning you think she doesnt know somethings trailing hershes an arrogant woman paran said his free hand gripping his sword and with that imass with her why should she

within the light damn seven cities superstitions anyway he growled under his breathparan looked at him oddly you say somethingno toc hunched down in his saddle the captain had been pushing them hard his obsession was running them down even with the extra mount the horses were near finished and a thought nagged toc what would happen when they caught up with the adjunct obviously paran intended to catch lorn and the imass spurred by vengeance that overwhelmed his previous intentions with lorn dead or her plans awry parans command would be safe he could join whiskeyjack and the squad at leisure assuming they still lived of coursetoc could think of a thousand flaws in the captains plans first and foremost was the tlan imass was parans sword its match in the past sorcery had been flung at the imass warriors with a frenzy born of desperation nothing had worked the only way to destroy an imass was to chop it to pieces toc didnt think the captains weapon godtouched as it was could do the job but there was no convincing paran of anything these daysthey came upon another raven its feathers fluttering in the wind its entrails swollen by the sun and bright red like cherries toc rubbed his scar again and almost fell from the saddle as an image clear and precise burgeoned in his head he saw a small shape moving so fast as to be but a blur horses screamed and a massive tear opened up in the air he jolted as if something large and heavy had struck him and the tear yawned swirling darkness beyond toc heard his own horse scream then it was gone and he found himself gripping the hinged horn of his saddle with all his strengthparan rode ahead apparently noticing nothing his back straight and his gaze fixed southward one hand played lightly on the swords pommeltoc shook himself leaned to one side and spat what had he just seenthat tearhow could the air itself be torn like that the answer came to him a warren an opening warren could do that he spurred his horse alongside

but hardly suspiciousand when she came close chance would sing it would be done and if necessary theyd deal with the imass afterwards he hoped that the imass would simply leave with the missions collapse without the adjunct everything would fall throughat least so he hoped chance might be a gifted sword but the tlan imass were elder creations born of sorceries that made oponn less than a childparans grip on the swords handle was tight his hand ached and he could feel sweat between his fingers chance felt no different from any other weapon should he be expecting something more he couldnt recall much of the time hed last used it against the hound but if there was power in the weapon should he not be able to sense it as it was chance felt cold as if he clutched a shard of ice that refused to melt in his grip if anything chance felt awkward as if he was a novice and held it wronglywhat had triggered this sudden crumpling of confidence pulling an ascendant into the fray how precisely do i do that of course if oponns as eager as last time maybe it was no more than just the tension that came with waiting for something to happen was toc mistaken he turned to the man beside him and opened his mouth to speaka loud manic cackle stopped him paran pulled savagely on the reinshis horse screamed and reared the air seemed to rip and a cold wind gusted against them the captain raised his sword and cursed the horse screamed again this time in pain it crumpled beneath him as if its bones had been turned to dust paran sprawled the sword flying from his hand as the ground rose up to meet him the horses fall had the sound of a bag filled with rocks and lamp oil landing beside him and rolling over his legstocs bowstring twanged and an arrow shattered against something hardparan pushed himself on to his side and looked upthe puppet hairlock floated above the ground twenty feet ahead a second arrow struck as the captain watched also shatteringhairlock laughed again swinging his mad stare to toc he gesturedparan cried out twisting to see toc thrown from his mount the claw cartwheeled through the air a jagged tear opened in the air in front of him paran shouted a second time in helpless horror as toc the younger plunged into that tear and disappeared into swirling mists the rent closed with a snap leaving no sign of parans companionhairlock descended slowly to the ground the puppet paused to adjust his tattered clothing then strode towards parani thought it might be you hairlock sniggered isnt vengeance sweeter than honey eh captain your death will be long protracted and very very painful imagine my pleasure at seeing you like thisparan pushed with his legs the horses body fell back freeing him he scrambled to his feet and dived for his sword grasping it while rolling then regained his feethairlock watched in evident amusement and began to advance that weapon is not for me captain itll not even cut me so the puppet came on wail awayparan raised the weapon a wave of despair coming over himhairlock stopped and cocked his head he whirled to face the northimpossible the puppet snarlednow paran caught what hairlock had already heard the howling of houndsin the hut quick ben had watched the ambush dumbfounded what was paran doing where was tattersail hoods path hed whispered angrily talk about losing track in any case it had all happened too fast for him to prevent the loss of the oneeyed man accompanying the captainhis eyes flew open and he snatched the scrap of cloth sorry he hissed sorry hear me woman i know you i know who you are cotillion patron of assassins the rope i call upon youhe felt a presence enter his mind followed by a mans voice well done quick benthe wizard said i have a message for you rope for shadowthronehe felt a heightened tension in his head a deals been struck your lords hounds hunger for vengeance i havent time to explain it all nowleave that to shadowthrone i am about to give to you the location of the one shadowthrone seekshe heard wry amusement in the ropes voice i provide the link correct the means by which you stay alive in all this i congratulate you quick ben few mortals have ever succeeded in avoiding my lords inclination to doublecross it seems you have outwitted him very well convey to me this location shadowthrone will receive it immediatelyquick ben cast forth hairlocks precise position on the rhivi plain he only hoped the hounds would arrive in time he had a lot of questions for paran and wanted the captain to reach them alive but he had to admit that the chances of that were slightall that remained for the wizard now was to prevent the puppets escape he smiled again that was something he looked forward toonos toolan had squatted before the standing stone since dawn in the hours since lorn had wandered the nearby hills at war with herself she now knew with a certainty that what they were doing was wrong that its consequences went far beyond the petty efforts of a mundane empire the tlan imass worked in the span of millennia their purposes their ownyet their endless war had become her endless war laseens empire was a shadow of the first empire the difference lay in that the imass conducted genocide against another species malaz killed its own humanity had not climbed up since the dark age of the imass it had spiralled downthe sun stood high overhead she had last looked upon tool an hour past the warrior had not moved an inch lorn climbed yet another hill already a quartermile distant from the standing stone she hoped to catch a glimpse of lake azur to the westshe came to the hills summit and found herself not thirty feet from four mounted travellers it was hard to determine who was more surprised but the adjunct moved first her sword rasping into her hands as she sprang to close the distancetwo were essentially unarmed a boy and a short fat man they and one other a gaudily dressed man now unsheathing a duelling rapier rode mules but it was the last man who held lorns attention fully armoured astride a horse he was the first to react to her charge bellowing he spurred his mount past the others and unsheathed a bastard swordlorn smiled as the fat man attempted to open a warren and failed her otataral blade steamed briefly before a cold wash of air poured from it the fat man his eyes widening reeled back in his saddle and promptly rolled over the mules rump landing heavily in the dust the boy leaped down from his own mount and paused unsure whether to aid the fat man or remove the dagger from his belt as the armoured man rode past him he reached his decision and ran to where the fat man had fallen the one with the rapier had also dismounted and approached in the warriors wakelorns eyes caught all this between blinks then the warrior was upon her swinging his bastard sword onehanded down towards her headthe adjunct didnt bother to parry instead she dodged in front of the horse to come up on the man from his left away from his sword armthe horse reared lorn darted past slicing her blade across the mans thigh above the plate armour the otataral edge sliced through chain links leather and flesh with equal easethe warrior grunted and clapped a mailed hand to the spurting wound even as the horse threw him from the saddleignoring him lorn engaged the duellist attempting to beat his thin blade aside and close to bring the edge of her weapon into play but the man was good deftly disengaging her attempted beat the swords swing unbalanced her before she could slow its momentum preparatory to an uppercut and in this moment the duellist extended his rapiershe cursed as her forward motion brought her on to the blades tipthe point pushed through the links of her hauberk and entered her left shoulder pain lanced like fire up her arm angered by the wound she swung her sword savagely at the mans head the flat of the blade caught him flush on the forehead and he sprawled back like a limp dolllorn cast a quick glance to where the warrior still struggled to stop the blood gushing from his leg then whirled to face the last two men the boy stood before the fat man who lay unconscious though his face was pale he held a thinbladed dagger in his left hand and a larger knife in the other his eyes were hard as he stared at herthe thought crossed lorns mind belatedly that she need not have attacked these men she wore mercenary garb and the tlan imass was not even within sight words might have achieved the same results and shed never liked shedding blood well it was too late for that now she advanced slowlywe meant no harm the boy said in daru leave us belorn hesitated the suggestion surprised her vmy ribtiae straightened agreed she answered in the same language patch up your friends and steer clearwell head back to darujhistan the boy said looking equally surprised well camp here and recover leave in the morningthe adjunct stepped back do that and youll stay alive try anything else and ill kill you all understoodthe boy noddedlorn backed away angling to the north shed head that way for a time then swing round to the east and come back down to where tool was she had no idea what had brought these men out into the hills but didnt suspect it had anything to do with her or even the barrow as she increased the distance between herself and the hill she saw the boy rush over to the warrior in any case she concluded there wasnt much left of that group to cause her worry the duellist wasnt dead but hed awake to a headache as for the warrior it was touch and go shed seen a lot of blood come from him the fat man might have broken his neck and as a mage he was harmless in her vicinity that left the boy and since when had she had cause to fear a boylorn quickened her paceafter the startling communication from quick ben sorry had contacted shadowthrone the lord of shadows had fumed briefly and after informing the rope that ben adeaphon delat had been a high priest of shadow sorry found herself sharing shadowthrones anger the man would pay for his many deceitsshadowthrones hounds had indeed been ready and she was sure that even now they closed the huntas she resumed her journey through her warren she met with increasing resistance a strange pressure with every step she took eastwardfinally she relented and emerged into the gadrobi hills it was midday and half a mile ahead rode the coin bearers party she closed the gap swiftly until she was no more than a hundred yards behind them gathering shadows about her as she wentthough even this proved increasingly difficult and that could mean only one thing a tlan imass was nearbyto what and to whom was the coin bearer riding had she miscalculated entirely were they agents for the malazan empire that possibility ran contrary to oponns influence but she had trouble arriving at any other conclusionthis she told herself would prove an interesting daythe party was fifty yards ahead making their way up a hillside they reached the summit and disappeared briefly from her view she quickened her pace only to hear sounds of fighting on the hilltopa fight in which otataral was unveileda flash of rage ran through her memory was attached to otataral a very personal memory cautiously she sought a vantage point at the hills crestthe exchange had been short and the coin bearers party looked near wiped out in fact only the coin bearer still stood facing a tall lithe woman wielding an otataral bladesorry recognized adjunct lorn on a mission no doubt for her dear empress a mission that included a tlan imass still out of sight but close she caught their conversation if the boys group werent agents for the empire then perhaps their master in darujhistan had sensed the presence of the imass out here and had sent them to investigateshe would discover the nature of the adjuncts mission later right now however it was time to kill the coin bearer and the near proximity of the imass made success all the more certain even oponns powers could not overcome the influence of a tellann warren murdering the boy would be easy sorry waited then smiled as adjunct lorn withdrew heading northin minutes the coin of oponn would be in her hands and this day a god might dieas soon as lorn was sufficiently distant crokus ran to the warriorsorry rose slowly into a crouch then moved forward in silence her garotte in her handsthe hounds howled again their eager cries closing in from all sideshairlock crouched indecisive then the puppet faced the captain youll have to wait a little longer to die captain ive no intention of allowing things to be rushed no i wish to linger over your demisechance sweaty in his hands paran shrugged to his own surprise it made little difference to him if the hounds arrived to find hairlock gone theyd probably take out their frustration on him and that would be that youll come to regret the opportunity hairlock whether this swords magic is meant for you or not i was looking forward to chopping you into kindling is your magic a match for my hatred it would have been nice to find outoh sudden bravery what do you know of hatred captain when i return ill show you precisely what hatred can achieve the wooden figure gestured and a dozen feet away another tear opened in the air this one exuding a fetid stench stubborn mutts hairlock muttered until later captain and he scurried for the rentin the hut quick bens grin turned savage he jerked the dagger free with his right hand and in a single fluid motion sliced thetaut strings connecting the sticksgoodbye hairlock he hissedparans eyes widened as the puppet flopped on to his stomach a moment later hairlock let loose a shriekthe captains eyes narrowed looks like somebody cut your strings hairlock he saidthe hounds were close in moments theyd be all over themyour life captain hairlock cried fling me into the warren and your life is yours i swear it paran leaned on his sword and made no replypawn of oponn hairlock snarled i would spit on you if i could spit on your soulthe earth rumbled and at once massive shapes moved around paran silently closing in on the immobile marionette paran recognized gear the hound hed wounded he felt the sword in his hands answer that challenge with an eager tremor that reached into his arms gears head swung in his direction as it passed and paran saw a promise in its eyes the captain smiled if anything draws oponn out it will be the fight to comehairlock shrieked one last time and then the hounds were upon him a large shadow passed across the hill and paran looked up to see great raven swooping over them the bird cawed hungrily too bad paran said to it i doubt its remains would be palatablethree hounds began fighting over the splintered woodall that was left of hairlock the remaining four led by gear now turned to paran the captain raised his sword and dropped into a combative crouch come on then through me to the god using me just once let the to turn in the twins hands come on hounds let us soak this ground with bloodthe creatures fanned out into a halfcircle gear in the centreparans smile broadened come to me gear im tired of being used and death doesnt seem so frightening any more lets be done with itsomething heavy pressed down on him as if a hand had reached down from the sky and tried to drive him into the earth the hounds flinched paran staggered unable to breathe a sudden darkness closing around the edges of his vision the ground groaned beneath him the yellowed grasses of the plain lying flat then the pressure lifted and chilled air flooded back into his lungs sensing a presence the captain whirledstep aside a tall blackskinned whitehaired man said as he pushe past to confront the hounds paran almost dropped his sword a tis andthe man wore a massive twohanded sword strapped to his back he stood before the hounds making no move towards the weaponthe seven had now arrayed themselves before them but they shifted restlessly warily eyeing the newcomerthe tiste and glanced at paran whatever youve done to draw the attention of gods it was unwise he said in malazanit seems i never learn paran repliedthe tiste and smiled then we are much alike mortalmortalthe hounds paced back and forth growling and snapping the air the tiste and watched them then spoke enough meddling i see you rood he said to one hound mangy brown scarred and yelloweye take your kin and leave tell shadowthrone i wont tolerate his interference my battle with malaz is my own darujhistan is not for himrood was the only hound not growling its glowing eyes bore steadily into the tiste and syou have heard my warning roodparan watched as the tiste and cocked his head slowly he returned his attention to the captain gear wishes you deadits the price i pay for showing mercythe tiste and raised an eyebrowparan shrugged see the scar he carriesthat was your mistake mortal you must finish what you set out to donext time what happens nowfor the moment mortal they find the thought of killing me more desirable than that of killing youand what are their chancesthe answer to that is evident in how long theyve been hesitating wouldnt you think mortalthe hounds attacked faster than anything paran could have imaginedhis heart lurched as a flurry of motion closed in around the other manas the captain stepped back an invisible fist of darkness exploded behind his eyes a snapping of massive chains the groan of huge wooden wheelshe squeezed shut his eyes against the staggering pain then forced them open again to see that the fight was over the tiste and had his sword in his hands its black blade slick with bloodblood that boiled and swiftly became ash two hounds lay unmoving one to either side of him a wayward wind drew a wintry breath across the scene with a sound like a gasp shivering the grassesparan saw that one hound had been nearly decapitated while the other had been sliced across its broad chestit did not look like a killing wound but the creatures eyes one blue the other veilow stared sightlessly skywardrood yelped and the others backed awayparan tasted blood in his mouth he spat then raised a hand to find blood trickling from his ears the pain in his head was ebbing he looked up just as the tiste and s head came round to face him seeing death in the mans eyes paran stepped back and half raised his sword though the effort took all his strength he watched uncomprehending as the tiste and shook his head for a moment i thought no i see nothing nowparan blinked stinging tears from his eyes then wiped his cheeks he started on seeing that the stain of those tears on his forearm was pinkyou just killed two hounds of shadowthe others withdrewwho are youthe tiste and did not answer his attention once more on the houndsbehind them a cloud of shadow was forming in the air deepening and thickening in its centre a moment later it dissipated and a black shrouded translucent figure stood in its place hands tucked into its sleeves shadows commanded whatever face lay hidden beneath the hoodthe tiste and lowered his swords point to the ground they were warned shadowthrone i want one thing understood you may prove my match here especially if your rope is about but i promise you it will be messy and there are those who will avenge me your existence shadowthrone could become uncomfortable now ive yet to lose my temper withdraw your realms influence from the proceedings and i will leave it at thati am not involved shadowthrone said quietly my hounds found the quarry i sought the hunt is over the gods head tilted to observe the two dead creatures over for all time for doan and ganrodshadowthrone looked up there is no release for themnone nor for any who would pursue vengeancea sigh issued from the hooded darkness of the gods face ah well as i said i am not involved however the rope isrecall him the tiste and commanded nowhe will be severely displeased anomander rake his plans extend far beyond darujhistan seeking to reach the malazan throne itselfanomander rake paran recalled tattersails convictions after scrying her deck of dragons the knight of high house dark the son of darkness the lord with the black sword and its deadly chainsruler of moons spawn or so she thought she saw this coming this very moment the clash between shadow and dark the blood spilledi fight my own battles rake growled and id rather deal with laseen on the malazan throne than with a servant of shadow recall himone last point shadowthrone said a giggle escaping him i am not responsible for whatever actions the rope might take against youa smile entered rakes tone convince him of the wise course shadowthrone i have no patience for your games if i am pushed by either you your hounds or by the rope ill make no distinction i will assail the shadow realm and you are invited to try to stop meyou lack all subtlety the god said sighing very well he paused and shadows swirled around him he has been recalled forcibly extracted as it were the field is yours once again anomander rake the malazan empire is all yours as is oponn shadowthrone addedoponn rakes head turned slowly and the captain once again looked into eyes of deep cold blue parans spirits sank the tiste and s gaze fell to the sword then again to shadowthrone begone rake said the matter is endedshadowthrone dipped his head for now the god raised his hands and shadows gathered around him the surviving hounds closed in leaving their dead kin where they lay the shadows thickened became opaque entirely hiding those within when they dispersed the lord and paran eyed the tiste and who now faced him after a moment the rakes brows rose thats it he asked thats the extent of your comments do i speak with oponn directly i thought it i sensed a presence before but when i looked more carefully nothing rake shifted grip on his sword the point rising do you hide within oponnnot as far as im aware paran replied apparently oponn saved my life or rather brought me back to life ive no idea why but ive been told that ive become oponns toolyou are journeying to darujhistanparan noddedmay i approach rake asked sheathing his sword why notthe tiste and strode up to him and laid a hand against his chest paran felt nothing untoward rake stepped back oponn may have been within you in the past but it seems the twins have hastily withdrawn i see their signs but no god controls you now mortal he hesitated their treatment of you was unkind if caladan brood was here he could heal thatyoure no longer oponns tool the tistes eyes remained blue but theyd there was a squawk nearby and both turned to see a great raven alight on one of the hounds bodies it plucked out an eye and gobbled it down paran fought back a wave of nausea the huge battered bird this mans sword master the raven said is not oponns only tool paran shook his head his only surprise the realization that nothing surprised him any more he sheathed his swordspeak on crone rake commandedrake frowned perhaps not he faced the captain again hold on to that weapon until your luck turns when that happens and if youre still alive break it or give it to your worst enemy a grin crossed his features thus far it seems your luck holdsparan hesitated im free to golord anomander rake noddedthe captain looked around then strode off in search of theminutes later the shock came to paran driving him to his knees toc was gone hed dragged the man with him in his relentless mindless pursuit across the plain he looked up eyes unseeing hed called hairlock his enemy hed proclaimed lorns death his final goal as if these two things would answer the anguish within him would heal the pain of lossbut the demon is within meoponn had been unkind what had rake meant have any of these thoughts been my own look at memy every move seems a desperate search for someone to blame always someone else ive made being a tool of a god an excuse a justification for not thinking for simply reacting and others have died for itrake had also said finish what you start he would have to deal with his own demons later there could be no turning back but it had been wrong to think that what he planned would end the pain within him adding lorns blood to his stained hands would not achieve what he soughtparan rose collected the reins of the surviving horses he led the beasts back to the scene of the fight the tiste and had vanished but the hounds remained motionless dark humps in the yellow grass he dropped the reins and approached one the slice across its chest still leaked blood crouching paran reached out ran his fingers along the animals hide see what the desire for murder gets you hoods breath but you were a beautiful beast his fingertips brushed blood the captain recoiled at the contact but it was too late something rippled up his arm swept through him he fell back into darkness the sound of chains rattling tautparan found himself walking and he was not alone through the gloom he could make out figures on all sides each shackled with long iron chains leaning forward as if pulling at an immense weight the ground underfoot was barren lifeless overhead there was nothing but darkness beneath the constant creak of the chains was a heavier sound that paran could feel through the soles of his boots alone unchained he fell back towards the source of that sound passing chained figures many of them not human a shape appeared hulking pitching a wagon impossibly huge its wooden wheels taller than a man driven by an insatiable desire to discover what it carried paran moved closera chain ripped across his chest throwing him from his feet an earpiercing howl sounded directly above him claws gouged his left arm pinning it to the ground a chain rippled under his back he struggled as a cold wet nose and savage teeth pushed under his chin the jaws i paran lay perfectly still waiting for the fatal clenching of those jawsinstead they pulled away he found himself staring up into the hounds eyes one blue one brown a massive collar of iron circled its neck the beast lunged away the chain under him snapped taut flinging paran into the air he felt more than heard the wagon groan sideways even as he landed sprawling into the path of one of the wooden wheelsa hand grasped the collar of his cloak and dragged him clear the captain scrambled to his feeta voice beside him spoke any man who has earned mercy from hounds and walks here unchained is a man worth talking to walk with methe shadow of a cowl hid the strangers features the man was big dressed in rags after releasing paran he resumed straining on his chainnever before he grunted has this prison been so tested he hissed as the wagon lurched yet again to the hounds frantic attempts to escapei fear this will overturnand if it doesthe face swung to him briefly and in the darkness paran saw the flash of teeth the pulling will get harderwhere are wethe warren within the sword did not dragnipur take your life tooif it had would i not be chained as welltrue enough what then are you doing herei dont know paran admitted i saw the hounds killed by rakes sword then i touched the blood of one of the slain beaststhat explains their confusion they thought you one of their own at first you were wise to submit to that hounds challengetoo frightened to move you meanthe stranger laughed even sowhat is your namenames are meaningless rake killed me long ago that is enoughparan fell silent eternity chained here forever pulling and i ask for the mans name would any apology sufficethe wagon bucked savagely earth ripped from under its wheelsfigures fell wailing the hounds howled their furygethols breath the stranger gasped will they never ceasei dont think they will paran said can those chains be brokenno none have managed it yet that is and there are dragons among us but these hounds he sighed it is astonishing but already i long for the peace their arrival has shatteredperhaps i can helpthe stranger barked a laugh by all means tryparan moved away heading towards the hounds he had no plan in mind but i alone am unchained the thought stopped him and he smiled unchained no ones tool he continued on wondering he passed figures straining step by step some silent some muttering in madness none raised its head to glance as he passed the sound of bestial gasping reached him hounds para called i would helpafter a time they appeared from the gloom blood sheathed their shoulders and chests the flesh torn and mangled by the collars the hounds trembled muscles jumping along their flanks their eyes level with parans own met his with such numbed helpless misery that his heart lurched he reached out to the oddeyed one i would examine your collars your chains seeking a flawthe beast walked alongside himthey were ever moving forward the wagon unceasing in its roll paran bent close running his hands on the collar seeking a join there was none where the chain attached the link and the collar seemed of one solid piece though he knew little of smithing he believed this attachment would prove the weakest element and should already show signs of strain but his fingertips told him otherwise the iron was not even scratchedparan ran his hand along the chain leaving the hounds side he paused noticing the other beast watching his every move then continued on from the animal to the wagon over seventy armspans of length he ran his hands from link to link seeking a change in the feel of the iron seeking heat gouges nothing he arrived alongside the wagon the wheel he walked behind was solid wood a span in width nicked and gouged but otherwise featureless the wall of the bed was twenty or more feet high the slatted sideboards of withered bonegrey wood showed spaces a fingers width between paran flinched back on seeing skeletal fingers crowding the cracks wriggling helplesslythe wagons frame beneath the sideboards drew his attentionhere the wood was black glistening with pitch chainends entered it countless in number sinking seamlessly into the wood under his touch the frame seemed solid yet it was as if the chain links passed through itwhatever held them then was beyond the wagons frameparan drew a deep breath of the cool stale air then ducked under the bedthe frames beam was a dozen spans thick condensation dripping down from its pitched underside in endless rain at the inside edge paran found once again the chains continuing on further under the wagon grasping one he followed it inward the links grew colder as did the air around him before long he was forced to release the chain his hands burned by the cold the rain from the underside of the wagon came down as slivers of ice two paces ahead the chains converged swallowed by a suspended pool of absolute darkness cold poured from it in pulsing waves paran could get no closerhe hissed in frustration as he scrambled along opposite the dark hole wondering what to do next even if he managed to break a chain he had no idea which ones belonged to the hounds as for the othersanomander rake seemed a creature of clearif coldjustice to break a chain could unleash ancient horrors upon the realms of the living even the stranger hed spoken with could once have been a tyrant a horrible dominatorparan unsheathed chance as the blade leaped free of the scabbard it bucked wildly in his hands the captain grinned even as tremors of terror reached through his hands from the sword oponn dear twins i call on you nowthe air groaned paran stumbled over someone who loosed a stream of curses sheathing his sword he reached down hand closing on brocaded cloth he pulled the god to his feet why you paran demanded i wanted your sistermadness mortal the male twin snapped to call me here so close to the queen of darknesshere within a godslaying swordparan shook him filled with a mindless bestial rage the captain shook the god he heard the hounds howl and fought back a sudden desire to join his voice to their criesthe twin terror in his bright eyes clawed at paran whatwhat are you doingparan stopped his attention drawn to two chains that had gone slacktheyre comingthe wagon seemed to leap upward rocked as it had never been before the thunder of the impact filled the air wood and ice cascading downthey have your scent twinthe god shrieked battered his fists into parans face scratching kicking but the captain held on not the luck that pulls he spat bloodthe luck that pushesthe wagon was hammered again its wheels bucking into the air to come down with a splintering echoing concussion paran had no time to wonder at the savage strength that coursed through him a strength sufficient to hold down a god gripped in panic he simply held onplease the twin begged anything just ask it anything within my powersthe hounds chains paran said break themii cannotthe wagon shuddered sickeningly distant wood splintering paran dragged the twin a pace as it rolled forward again think of a way he said or the hounds will have youii cannot be sure paranwhat you cant be sure of whatthe twin gestured towards the blackness in there the chains are held in place within itwithin the warren of darkness within kurald galain should they enter i do not knowi cannot be certain but the chains may disappearhow can they enterthey could be leaving one nightmare only to enter anotherit cannot be worse twin i asked you howbaitwhatthe twin smiled shakily as you said theyre coming but paran you must release me by all means hold me before the portal but please at the last momenti release my hold on youthe god noddedvery wellthe hounds struck the wagon again and this time they broke through clutching the twin paran spun round to see the beasts charging out of the gloom his captive shriekedthe hounds leapedparan released the god dropping flat to the ground as the hounds passed through the air above the twin vanished the hounds flashed past disappeared into the portal in silence and were goneparan rolled to his feet even as darkness reached out for him not with the cold of oblivion but with a breath like warm sighing windhe opened his eyes to find himself on his hands and knees on the plains yellowed grass beside a flattened bloodsmeared patch where the body of a hound had once lain insects buzzed close by his head aching paran climbed to his feet the other hounds body was gone as well what had he done and why of all the things that the twin could have offered him tattersail toc the younger then again to pluck a soul back through hoods gate was not likely within oponns power to achieve had he freed the hounds he realized he would probably never knowhe staggered over to the horses at least for a short time there he had been unchained he had been free and what he had done he had done by his own choice my own choicehe looked to the south darujhistan and the adjunct await me finish what you started paran finish it once and for alldamn inconvenient coll growled as crokus completed tying the bandage she was good he added she knew exactly what to do id say shed been trained sort of fits since she was dressed like a

the summits crest behind herthe girl saw that she stood at the very edge of a steep slope oddly enough this seemed to relax her she moved a few steps closer to crokus her wide eyes searching histhats

uncle knows the right people they can help her lad now saddle up my horse ill wait here for our friends to wake hell i cant walk anyway i shouldnt move for at least a couple of days kruppe and murillio will handle things here gocrokus eyed the weeping girl then he said all right coll well go back me and hergood coll grunted now lay me out a bedroll and some food then ride on out of here and if that damn horse of mine has a heart attack outside the city gates even better hop to it ladchapter sixteendessembrae knows the sorrows in our soulshe walks at the side of each mortal a vessel of regret on the fires of vengeancedessembrae knows the sorrows and would now share them with us allthe lord of tragedy holy book prayer canon of kassalthe puncture wound in lorns left shoulder was not deep without magical aid however the risk of infection was a cause for concern she returned to the camp to find tool still positioned where he had been since dawnignoring the imass the adjunct found her collection of herbs in her saddle bag she sat down and leaned back against the saddle then set to treating the woundit had been a foolish unnecessary attack too many things had happened recently too many ideas too much of the woman lorn interfering with her functions and duties as adjunct to the empress she was making mistakes that she would not have made a year agotool had given her more to think about than she could handle the words the imass had thrown at her feet as if in afterthought had reached into and grasped something deep within her and now would not let go emotions seeped into the adjunct clouding the world around hershed abandoned sorrow long ago along with regret compassion was anathema to the adjunct yet now all these feelings swept through her in tides pulling her every which way she found herself clinging to the title of adjunct and what it meant as if it was a lifeline to sanity to stability and controlshe completed cleaning the wound as best she could then prepared a poultice control the word rebounded in her thoughts clipped hard and sure what was the heart of empire if not control what shaped empress laseens every act her every thought and what had been at the heart of the very first empirethe great wars that shaped the tlan imass to this dayshe sighed and looked down at the dirt beneath her but that was no more than we all sought she told herself from a young girl bringing twine home to her father to the immortal power that had seized her for its own use through the gamut of life we struggled for control for a means to fashion the world around us an eternal hopeless hunt for the privilege of being able to predict the shape of our livesthe imass and his threehundredthousandyearold words had given to lorn a sense of futility and it worked on her it threatened to overwhelm hershed given the boy his life surprising both him and herself lorn smiled ruefully prediction had become a privilege now lost to her never mind the outside world she could not even guess her own actions or the course of her thoughtswas this the true nature of emotion she wondered the great defier of logic of controlthe whims of being human what lay aheadadjunctstartled lorn looked up to see tool standing over her frost covered the warrior steaming in the heatyou have been woundeda skirmish she said gruffly almost embarrassed its over now she pressed the poultice against the wound then wrapped cloth around her shoulder it was an awkward effort since she could use only one handtool knelt beside her i will assist you adjunctsurprised lorn studied the warriors deaths face but his next words wiped out any thought of the imass revealing compassionwe have little time adjunct the opening awaits usan expressionless mask settled over her face she jerked a nod as tool finished his withered shredded handsthe nails blunt polished brown and curveddeftly tying a knot with the strips of cloth help me to my feet she commandedthe marker had been shattered she saw as the imass guided her forward apart from this however all looked unchanged where is this opening she askedtool halted before the broken stones i will lead adjunct follow closely behind me when we are within the tomb unsheath your sword the deadening effect will be minimal yet it will slow the jaghuts return to consciousness enough for us to complete our effortslorn drew a deep breath she shrugged off her doubts there was no turning back now had there ever been such a chance the question she realized was a moot one the course had been chosen for her very well she said lead on toolthe imass spread out his arms to the sides the hillside before them blurred as if a curtain of windblown sand rose before it a churning wind roiled through this strange mist tool stepped forwardfollowing lorn at first recoiled at the stench that wafted into her a stench of air poisoned by centuries of pulsing sorcery countless wards dispersed by tools tellann powers she pushed ahead her eyes fixing on the imasss broad tattered backthey entered the hillside a rough corridor leading into darkness appeared before them frost limned the stacked boulders forming the walls and ceiling as they went further the air grew bitter cold stripped of scents and thick green and white ropes of ice tracked the walls the floor which had been frozen packed earth became slabs of stone slick with icenumbness seeped into lorns extremities and her face she saw her breath curl in a white stream drawn inward to the darkness beyond the corridor narrowed and she saw strange symbols painted on and within the ice streaking the walls dull red ochre in colour these markings brushed something deep inside hershe almost recognized them but as soon as she concentrated on doing so the sensation of familiarity vanishedtool spoke my people have visited here before he said pausing to look at the adjunct over one shoulder they added their own wards to those of the jaghut who imprisoned this tyrantlorn was irritated what of itthe imass stared at her in silence then replied dully adjunct i believe i know the name of this jaghut tyrant i am now beset by doubts it should not be freed yet like you i am compelledlorns breath caughtadjunct tool continued i acknowledge the ambivalence you have been feeling i share it when this is done i shall leaveshe was confused leavetool nodded within this tomb and with what we will do my vows are ended they will bind me no longer such is the residual power of this sleeping jaghut and for that i am thankfulwhy are you telling me thisadjunct you are welcome to accompany melorn opened her mouth but could think of no immediate reply so shut it againi ask that you consider my offer adjunct i shall journey in search of an answer and i shall find itanswer to what she wanted to ask yet something stopped her a surge of fear that said to her you dont want to know remain ignorant in this lets get on with it she gratedtool resumed his march into the darknessafter a minute lorn asked how much time is this going to taketime there was amusement in his voice within this barrow adjunct time does not exist the jaghut who imprisoned their kin brought an age of ice to this land the barrows final seal adjunct a halfleague of ice stands over this burial chamberstill we have come to a time and place before the faltering of the jaghut ice before the coming of the great inland sea known to the imass as jhagra til before the passing of countless agesand when we return lorn interrupted how much time will have passedi cannot say adjunct the imass paused and turned back to her his eye sockets glimmering with a sourceless light i have never done this beforedespite the hardened leather armour the feel of a woman pressing against crokuss back had brought to his face more sweat than the afternoon heat could account for yet it was a mix of feelings that had his heart thumping against his chest on the one hand was the bald fact that here was a girl of nearly his age and an attractive one at that with surprisingly strong arms wrapped around his waist and her warm moist breath on his neck on the other hand this woman had murdered a man and the only reason he could think of her arriving on the scene back there in the hills was that shed been planning to kill him too so he found himself too tense to enjoy sharing the saddle with herthey had said little to each other since leaving coll in another da crokus knew darujhistans walls would come into view he wondered if shed remember it and then a voice spoke in his head that soundel like colls why dont you ask the girl idiot crokus scowledshe spoke first is itko kan far from herehe thought about laughing but somethingan instinctstopped him tread softly he told himself ive never heard of such a place he said its in the malazan empireyes we arent in the empirecrokus growled not yet then his shoulders slumped were on a continent called genabackis the malazans came from the seas both east and west they now control all the free cities to the north as well as the nathilog confederacyoh the girl replied weakly youre at war with the empire thenmore or less though youd never know it as far as darujhistan is concernedis that the name of the town you live intown darujhistans a city its the biggest richest city in all the landthere was awe and excitement in her reply a city ive never been to a city your name is crokus isnt ithow did you know thatthats what your soldier friend called youoh of course why did the fact that shed known his name send his heart lurchingarent you going to ask me my name the woman asked quietlyyou can remember itno she admitted thats strange isnt ithe heard pathos in that reply and something melted insidemaking him even angrier well i cant very well help you in that can the woman seemed to withdraw behind him and her arms loosened their grip noabruptly his anger fell away crokus was ready to scream at the chaos in his head instead he shifted in the saddle forcing her to clutch him tightly ah he smirked thats better then his eyes widened what am i sayingcrokuswhatgive me a darujhistan name pick one pick your favouritechallice he responded immediately no wait you cant be challice i already know a challice youve got to be someone elseis she your girlfriendno he snapped he pulled at the reins and they stopped crokus clawed at his hair then threw a leg over and dropped to the ground he pulled the reins over the horses head i want to walk he saidyes she said i would like to toowell maybe i want to runshe stepped round to face him her expression troubled run from me crokushe saw things falling into ruins behind her eyeswhat were those things he felt a desperate need to know but asking straight out was clearly impossible why it was impossible he couldnt say it just was he looked down at the ground and kicked at a rock no he mumbled i didnt mean that sorryher eyes widened that was my narne she gasped that was my name crokusyou just said my namewhat he frowned sorryyes she looked away only it wasnt always my name i dont think no it wasnt the name my father gave mecan you remember that oneshe shook her head and ran a hand through her long dark haircrokus started walking and the girl fell into step beside him the road wound down through the low hills in an hour theyd reach the catlin bridge the panic that had filled him was subsiding perhaps having burned itself out he felt relaxed and that surprised him since he couldnt recall the last time hed felt relaxed in a females companythey walked in silence for a time ahead the sun sank down in a golden blaze shimmering along a blue and green line on the horizon beyond the hills crokus pointed to the glistening line thats lake azur darujhistan lies on its south shorehavent you thought of a name for me yet the woman askedthe only name that comes to mind crokus said sheepishly is my matronsthe girl glanced at him your motherscrokus laughed no not that kind of matron i meant the lady of thieves apsalar only its not good to take that kind of name since shes a goddess what about salarher nose wrinkled no i like apsalar make it apsalarbut i just saidthats the name i want the girl insisted her face darkeninguhoh crokus thought better not press this one all right he sighedso youre a thiefwhats wrong with thatapsalar grinned given my new name nothing nothing at all crokus when do we camphe blanched he hadnt thought about that maybe we should just push on he said warily not meeting her eyesim tired why dont we camp at this catlin bridgewell ive only got the one bedroll you can have it ill stand watchall night whats there to watch out forcrokus rounded on her why all these questions he demanded hod its dangerous out here didnt you see colls wound and how do i know the garrisons still therewhat garrisoncrokus cursed himself he averted his gaze the garrison on the other side of the bridge he said but its a long bridgeoh come on crokus apsalar laughed and drove her elbow into his ribs well share the bedroll i dont mind so long as you keep your hands to yourselfrubbing his ribs crokus could only stare at hercursing kruppe glared over his shoulder at murillio damnation cant you urge that beast any fasterthe mule was living up to its reputation refusing anything but a plodding walk murillio grinned sheepishly whats the big hurry kruppe the boy can take care of himselfit was master baruks explicit command that we guard him and guard him we must murillios eyes narrowed so you keep saying he muttered is this some favour on mammots behalf has the boys uncle got all worried all of a sudden whys baruk so interested in crokus you convey the alchemists orders kruppe but you dont explain themkruppe reined in his mount oh very well he said mutiny in the ranks forces kruppes sly hand oponn has chosen crokus for whatever purposes the devious deity may devise baruk would have us keep an eye on the lad and more prevent any other powers from finding himmurillio rubbed the bruise on his forehead and winced damn you he sighed you shouldve explained all this from the start kruppe does rallick knowof course not kruppe replied tartly hes too busy after all unable to extricate himself from his various responsibilities hence kruppes expression turned crafty the assassins absence on this journey but why pray tell is kruppe informing murillio of such things clearly murillio knows more of rallicks doings than poor ignorant kruppemurillios look was blank what do you meankruppe sniggered then kicked his mule into motion once againmurillio followedand as for our present mission kruppe continued blithely what seems a vast failure particularly on colls part is in truth an astonishing success master baruk must be made aware of the nefarious activities afoot in the gadrobi hillssuccess what are you talking aboutkruppe waved a hand dear man though i was conscious but a moment during the fracas clear it was that this woman warrior possessed an otataral sword which means as any child might guess shes malazanmurillio hissed slowly between his teeth and we left coll back there are you insane kruppehell mend enough to follow us shortly kruppe said the need for haste overwhelms all other considerationsexcept cheap deals with a certain stabler murillio growled so theres some malazan in the gadrobi hills whats she up to and dont try telling me you dont know if you didnt suspect something we wouldnt be in such a hurrysuspicions indeed kruppe nodded his shoulders hunching recall crokus uttering that perceptive comment as we left the crossroads hunting a rumour or some such thingwait a ininute murillio groaned not that barrow legend again theres not akruppe held up a finger and cut in smoothly what we believe is irrelevant murillio the fact remains that the malazans are seeking the truth of that rumour and both kruppe and master baruk suspect being of equal intelligence that they might well discover it hence this mission my fluttery friend he waggled his brows otataral in the hands of a swordmaster of the empire a tlan imass lurking in the vicinitywhat murillio exploded his eyes wide he made to turn his mule around but the beast complained and planted its hoofs he struggled with it cursing colls all cut up and hes got a malazan killer out there and an imass youve lost your mind kruppebut dear murillio kruppe crooned kruppe would have thought you eager nay desperate to return to darujhistan as quickly as possible that stopped the man he rounded on kruppe face darkening come on he gritted out with it thenkruppes brows rose out with whatyouve been hinting about something poking me with it so if you think you know something about whatever lets hear it otherwise we turn round right now and head back to coll seeing kruppes eyes dart murillio grinned hah you thought to distract me didnt you well its not going to workkruppe raised his hands palm up no matter whose brain was responsible for your scheme to return coll to his rightful title kruppe can do naught but eagerly applaudmurillios jaw dropped how in hoods name did kruppethe man continued but all that is inconsequential when faced with the fact of crokus and the grave danger he is presently in more if this young girl was indeed possessed as coll suspects the risks are frightening to behold was she the only hunter for the lads frail unprotected life what of the thousand gods and demons who would eagerly confound oponn at the first opportunity thus would murillio friend of long standing with crokus so callously abandon the child to the fates is murillio a man to succumb to panic to whatifs to a host of imagined nightmares slinking about within the shadows of his overwrought imaginationall right murillio barked now hold your tongue and lets ridekruppe gave a brusque nod at this wise remarkan hour later as dusk clambered up the hillsides and ever westward to the dying sun murillio started and threw kruppe a furious glare that was lost in the gloom damn him he whispered i said i wasnt about to let him distract me so whats the first thing he does distract memurillio murmurs something kruppe askedmurillio massaged his forehead im having dizzy spells he saidlets find a camp crokus and the girl wont make it to the city before tomorrow anyway i doubt hes in any danger on the road and well find him easily enough before tomorrows sunset they should be fine in the daytimehell theyll be with mammot rightkruppe admits to his own weariness indeed a camp should be found and murillio can construct a small fire perhaps and so prepare dinner while kruppe ponders vital thoughts and suchfine murillio sighed just fineit came to captain paran a couple days after his encounter with the tiste and and the events within the lords sword that rake had not suspected him to be a malazan soldier or hed be dead oversights blessed him it seemed his assassin in pale should have checked twiceand now the son of darkness snatching him from the jaws of the hounds had in turn let him walk free was there a pattern to this it had oponns flavour yet paran didnt doubt rakes assertionthen did his luck indeed lie in his sword and had these mercies of fortune marked pivotal momentsmoments that would come back to haunt those whod spared him for his own wellbeing he hoped nothis was no longer the empires road hed walked that path of blood and treachery for too long never again what lay before him then was the singular effort to save the lives of whiskeyjack and the squad if he managed that he would not begrudge his own death as a consequencesome things went beyond a single mans life and maybe justice existed outside the minds of humanity beyond even the hungry eyes of gods and goddesses a thing shining and pure and final some philosophers hed read during his schooling in the malazan capital unta had asserted what seemed to him then an absurd position morality was not relative they claimed nor even existing solely in the realm of the human condition no they proclaimed morality as an imperative of all life a natural law that was neither the brutal acts of beasts nor the lofty ambitions of humanity but something other something unassailablejust another hunt for certainty paran scowled and stiffened in his saddle his eyes fixed on the trader track winding before him through low rounded hills he recalled discussing this with adjunct lorn at a time when neither had been compelled by the outside world just another hunt for certainty shed said in a voice brittle and cynical putting an end to the discussion as clearly as if shed driven a knife into the winestained table between themfor such words to have come from a woman no older than him paran suspected then as he did now that her particular view had been no more than an easy lazy mimicry of empress laseens but laseen had a right to it and lorn did not at least in parans mind if anyone had a right to worldweary cynicism it was the empress of the malazan empiretruly had the adjunct made herself laseens extension but at what cost hed seen the young woman behind the mask just onceas theyd looked out over a road carpeted with dead soldiers then proceeded to pick their way through them the pale frightened girl that was lorn had shown herself in a single frail moment he couldnt remember what had triggered the return of the masklikely it had been something hed said something hed tossed off in his own guise as a hardened soldierparan sighed deeply too many regrets lost chancesand with each one passing the less human we all became and the deeper into the nightmare of power we all sankwas his life irretrievable he wished he had an answer to that questionmovement in the south caught his attention and with it he became aware of a rumbling sound rising up from the earth around him he rose in the saddle a wall of dust curled over the ridge of land directly aheadhe swung his mount westward and nudged it into a trot moments later he reined in the curtains of dust hung in that direction as wellcursing he spurred to the crest of a nearby rise dust dust on all sidesa storm no the thunder is too regular he rode down to the plain below and reined in again wondering what to do the dust wall rose cresting the hill he faced the deep rumbling grew paran squinted into the dust dark massive shapes moved there spreading out to either side sweeping down on his position in moments he was surroundedbhederin hed heard tales of the huge shaggy creatures moving across the inner plains in herds half a million strong on all sides paran could see nothing but the humped reddishbrown dustcaked backs of the beasts there was nowhere he could lead his horse no place of safety within sight paran leaned back in his saddle and waitedsomething flashed to his left tawny and low to the ground the captain half turned just as something heavy hammered him from the right and clung dragging him from the saddle cursing paran thumped heavily in the dust grappling with wiry limbs ragged black hair he drove his knee up connecting with a solid stomach his attacker rolled to one side gasping paran scrambled to his feet found himself facing a youth in tanned hides the boy sprang to close with the captain once againparan sidestepped and clouted the boy on the side of the head his attacker sprawled unconsciouspiercing cries were sounding on all sides the bhederin were parting moving away figures emerged closing on parans position rhivi sworn enemies to the empire allied in the north with caladan brood and the crimson guardtwo warriors came to the unconscious boys side each took an arm and dragged him offthe herd had come to a stopanother warrior approached striding boldly up to paran his duststreaked face was stitched with dyed threads black and red from high on the cheeks down to the jawline then up and around the mouth a bhederin hide rode the broad line of his shoulders stopping less than an arms length in front of paran the warrior reached out and closed his hand on the grip of chance paran struck away the hand the rhivi smiled stepped back and loosed a highpitched ululating cryfigures rose on the backs of the surrounding bhederin lances balanced in one hand as they crouched on the shaggy backs the huge animals beneath the warriors ignored them as if they were but tickbirdsthe two rhivi who had taken the boy away now returned joining the stitchfaced warrior who said something to the one on his left this man moved forward before paran could react he surged into motion throwing a leg behind the captain then driving his shoulder into parans chestthe warrior fell on top of him a knife blade slid against the line of parans jaw sliced through the helmet strap the iron skullcap was pulled away and fingers snagged a handful of his hair dragging the warrior with him paran pushed himself upright hed had enoughdeath was one thing death without dignity quite another as the rhivis hand twisted pulling his head up the captain reached between the warriors legs and found his own handful he yanked hardthe warrior shrieked releasing parans hair a knife appeared again flashing at the captains face he ducked to one side his free hand snapping up to grasp the wrist pushing away the knife he squeezed once more with his other hand the rhivi shrieked again then paran let go twisted round and drove his armoured elbow into the mans faceblood spattered like rain in the dust the warrior reeled back crumpled to the grounda lance haft hammered a glancing blow along parans temple he spun round with the impact a second lance struck him in the hip hard as a kick from a horse numbing his leg something pinned his left foot to the groundparan unsheathed chance the weapon was almost knocked from his hand with a ringing pealing sound he swung it upward and it was struck again half blinded with pain sweat and dust paran reared upright shifting to a twohanded grip and drawing chance down to a centre guard position the swords blade was struck a third time but he retained his gripthere was silence gasping blinking paran raised his head looked aroundrhivi surrounded him but none moved their dark eyes were wideparan flicked his gaze to his weapon glared back up and around at the warriors then his eyes returned to chance and stayed therethree iron lanceheads sprouted from the blade like leaves each point split and jammed the hafts shattered and gone leaving only white wood jutting out from the socketshe looked down at his pinned foot a lance had struck through his boot but the wide blade of the head was turned its flat side pressing against his foot splintered wood surrounded him paran glanced at his hip saw no wound a jagged tear marred the leather of chances scabbardthe rhivi warrior with the smashed face lay motionless a few feet from where paran stood the captain saw that his mount and the packhorses were untouched and had not moved the other rhivi had pulled back the encirclement now divided as a small figure approacheda girl perhaps no more than five years old the warriors moved aside from her as if in awe or fear possibly both she wore antelope skins tied with cord at the waist and nothing on her feetthere was something familiar about her a way of walking her stance as she stopped before himsomething in her heavylidded eyesthat made paran frown uneasilythe girl stopped to regard him her small round face slowly coming to mirror parans own frown she raised one hand as if reaching for him then dropped it the captain found he could not pull away his eyes from her child do i know youas the silence between them lengthened an old woman came up up behind the girl rested a wrinkled hand on her shoulder looking worn almost exasperated the old woman studied the captain the girl beside her said something the quick lilting language of the rhivi surprisingly lowpitched for one so young the old woman crossed her arms the girl spoke again insistentlythe old woman addressed paran in daru five lances claimed you as our enemy she paused five lances were wrongyouve plenty more paran saidso we have and the god favouring your sword has no followers hereso finish it paran growled im tired of the gamethe girl spoke a tone of command that rang like iron on stonethe old woman turned in obvious surprisethe girl continued her words now evidently explanatory the old woman listened then swung her dark glittering gaze back to the captainyou are malazan and malazans have chosen to be the enemies of the rhivi is this choice yours as well and know this i will recognize a lie when i hear iti am malazan by birth paran said i have no interest in calling the rhivi my enemy i would rather have no enemies at allthe old woman blinked she offers you words to ease your grief soldiermeaningyou are to liveparan did not quite trust this turn of events what words has she for me ive never seen her beforenor has she seen you before yet you know each otherno we dontthe old womans eyes hardened will you hear her words or not she offers you a gift will you throw it back in her faceprofoundly uneasy he said no i suppose notthe child says you need not grieve the woman you know has not passed through the arching trees of death her journey was beyond the lands you can see beyond those of the spirit that all mortals sense and now she has returned you must be patient soldier you will meet again so this child promiseswhich wornan paran demanded his heart poundingthe one you thought deadhe looked again at the girl the familiarity returned like a blow to his chest he staggered back a step not possible he whisperedthe girl withdrew dust swirling she vanishedwait another cry sounded the herd lurched into motion closing in obscuring the rhivi in moments all paran could see were the backs of the giant beasts shuffling past he thought to push among them but knew it would bring him only deathwait the captain shouted again but the sound of hundredsthousandsof hoofs on the plain drowned his effortstattersailit was fully an hour before the bhederin herds tail end appeared as the last of the beasts strolled past the captain he looked around the wind rolled the dust cloud eastward over the sloping humped hillsparan climbed into the saddle swung his mount southward once again the hills of gadrobi rose before him tattersail what did you dohe recalled toc noting the trail of small prints leading from the scorched pillar that had been all that was left of bellurdan and tattersail hoods breath did you plan such a thing and why the rhivi reborn already a child of five maybe sixare you even mortal any more woman have you ascended youve found yourself a people a strange primitive peopleto what end and when we next meet how old will you appear to be thenhe thought again about the rhivi theyd been driving the herd north a herd big enough to feed an army on the march caladan broodhes on his way to pale that is something i dont think dujeks prepared for old onearms in troublehe had another two hours of riding before sunset beyond the gadrobi hills was lake azur and the city of darujhistan and within the city whiskeyjack and his squad and in that squad a young woman ive been preparing to meet for three years the god possessing heris he even my enemy any morethe question arrived unbidden turning his heart cold gods what a journey this has been and here i had thought to travel this plain unnoticed a foolish thought scholars and mages write endlessly of fell convergencesit seems i am a walking convergence a lodestone to draw ascendants to their peril it seems my sword chance answered those five lances despite my treatment of one of the twins how to explain that the truth is my cause has become my own not the adjuncts not the empires i said id rather have no enemies at alland the old woman saw those as true words and so it seems they areendless surprises ganoes paran ride on see what comesthe track climbed a hillside and the captain spurred his horse up the slope reaching the summit he yanked hard on the reins the horse snorted indignantly and swung her head round eyes rolling but parans attention was elsewhere he leaned back in the saddle and loosened sworda heavily armoured man struggled to his feet beside a small campfirebeyond him was a hobbled mule the man tottered his weight on one leg and unsheathed a bastard sword which he then leaned on as he regarded the captainparan nudged his mount forward scanning the immediate area it seemed that the warrior was alone he brought his horse to a halt with thirty feet between themthe man spoke in daru im in no shape for a fight but if you want one its yoursonce again paran found himself thankful for the adjuncts insistence that he be thoroughly schooled his reply was as fluent as this nativesno ive lost the taste for it he waited leaning forward in the saddle then grinned at the mule is that beast a war mulethe man barked a laugh im sure it thinks it is he said relaxingive food to spare traveller if youre of a mindthe captain dismounted and approached my names paran he saidhe sat down by the firethe other followed suit the fire between them coll he grunted stretching out a bandaged leg you down from the northgenabaris initially spent some time in pale recentlycolls brows rose at that youve the look of a mercenary he said though likely an officer i heard it was pretty bad up therei arrived a little late paran admitted saw lots of rubble and lots of dead so im inclined to believe the stories he hesitated then said there was a rurnour in pale that moons spawn is now over darujhistancoll grunted tossing a handful of sticks on to the fire so it is he said he gestured at a battered pot tucked against the coals thats stew if youre hungry help yourselfparan realized he was famished he accepted colls offer gratefully as he ate using a wooden spoon the man loaned him he thought to ask about that leg wound but then he recalled his claw training when you play a soldier you play it to the hilt nobody talks about whats obvioussomething staring you in the eye you look around it and grumble about the weather anything important will come out in its own time soldiers have nothing to look forward to making patience an easy virtue and sometimes its not just a virtue but a contest of indifference so paran emptied the pot while coll waited in casual silence poking at the fire and adding the occasional stick from an enormous pile behind himwhere the wood had come from was anybodys guessfinally paran wiped his mouth with his sleeve and scrubbed the spoon as clean as he could manage without water he sat back then and belchedcoll spoke you heading into darujhistan theni am and youshould be able to manage it in another day or so though i cant say im looking forward to riding into the city on the back of a muleparan looked westward well he said squinting suns about down mind if i share this camp for the nightby all meansthe captain rose and attended to his horses he thought about delaying a day to let this man mend some more then lending him a horse if he rode into the city in the company of a local thered be advantagessomeone to direct him perhaps even give him a place to stay for a day or two not only that but he might learn something in the meantimewould another day matter possibly but it looked worth it he hobbled the wickan horses near the mule then carried his saddle back to the firebeen thinking about your problem paran said as he dropped the saddle and sat with his back against it ill ride in with you you can use my pack horsecolls eyes were alert a generous offerseeing the mans suspicion paran smiled the horses could use the extra days rest for one second ive never before been to darujhistan so in exchange for my socalled generosity id like to plague you with endless questions in the next two days after that i get my horse back and youre on your way and if anyones come out ahead its mebetter warn you now paran im not much of a talkerill take the riskcoll considered for a time hell he said id be mad not to accept wouldnt i you dont look the type to stick me in the back i dont know your real story paran if thats something you want to keep to yourself thats your business that wont stop me from asking questions though its up to you whether you lie or noti think that goes both ways doesnt it paran responded well you want my story straight fine here it is coll im a deserter from the malazan army ranked as captain i also did a lot of work with the claw and looking back on it thats where the trouble started anyway its done oh yes and one more thing people who get close to me usually end up deadcoll was silent his eyes glittering in the firelight and fixed on the man opposite him then he puffed his cheeks and blew out a loud breath of air truth as bald as that makes a challenge dont it he stared into the fire then leaned back on his elbows and lifted his face to the stars now appearing overhead i was once a noble in darujhistan the last son of a longlined powerful family i was set for an arranged marriage but i fell in love with another womana hungry ambitious woman though i was blind to that he smiled wryly she was a whore in fact only where most whores ive met are pretty downtoearth she was as twisted a soul as you could imaginehe passed a hand across his eyes anyway i refuted my obligations and broke off the arranged marriage it killed my father i think when i married aystalthat was the whores name though shes changed it since he laughed harshly at the night sky didnt take her long im still not sure how she managed the details how many men she took to bed to buy their influence or how they did it all i know is i woke up one day and found myself stripped of title stripped even of my family name the estate was hers the money was hers it was all hers and her need for me had endedthe flames licked the dry wood between them paran said nothing he sensed that more was to come from the man opposite him and that coll was struggling with itbut that wasnt the worst betrayal paran he said at length meeting the captains eyes oh no that came when i walked away from it i couldve fought her i might even have won his jaw tautenedthe only hint of anguish that escaped his selfcontrolthen he continued in a flat empty voice acquaintances id known for decades looked right through me to everyone i was dead they chose not to hear me they just walked past or didnt even come to the gates of their estates when i called on them i was dead paran even the citys records claimed it and so i agreed with them i walked away disappeared its one thing to have your friends mourn your passing in your face but its another to betray your own life paran but as you said its donethe captain looked away squinting into the darkness whats this human urge he wondered that brings us to such devastation the games of the high born he said quietly span the world i was born a noble like you coll but in malaz wed met our match in the old emperor he crushed us at every turn until we cowered like whipped dogs cowered for years but it was only an issue of power wasnt it he said more to himself than to the man who shared the fire there are no lessons worthy enough for a noble to heed i look back on my years within that twisted hungry companyi look back on that life now coll and i see it wasnt a life at all he was silent for a time then a slow smile curved his mouth and his gaze swung to coll since i walked away from the malazan empire and severed once and for all the dubious privileges of my noble blood damn ive never felt so alive it was never a life before only the palest shadow of what ive now found is that a truth most of us are too frightened to facecoll grunted im not the sharpest man youll meet paran and your thoughts are running a touch too deep for me but if i understand you right youre sitting there looking at a choppedup old fool of a man and youre telling him hes alive right now as alive as can be and whatever he betrayed back then it wasnt life was ityou tell me collthe man grimaced and ran a hand through his thinning hair the thing is i want it back i want it all backparan burst out laughing and continued to laugh until sharp pains cramped his stomachcoll sat watching him then a low rumbling chuckle rose from his chest he reached back retrieved a handful of sticks and tossed them into the fire one at a time well dammit paran he said amused lines crinkling around his eyes youve come out of the blue like a godsent bolt of lightning and i appreciate it i appreciate it more than youll ever knowparan wiped tears from his eyes hoods breath he said just one war mule talking to another righti guess so paran now if youll look in that pack of mine youll find a jug of worrytown wine its vintage is about a weekthe captain rose meaningmeaning its running out of timebook six the city of blue firerumours like tattered flags windsnapped and echoing in the streets below told the tale of the days upon ustwas said an eel had

a large beefy woman stepped out from a shadowed niche and conronted him he raised an eyebrow you want something meesenever mind what i want she grinned invitingly youve known about that for years anyway i come to tell ya something nom so relaxhe crossed his arms and waiteds a meese glanced back up the alley then hunched close to the assassintheres someone in the bar been asking for ya by namestartled rallick straightened whats he look like he asked casuallylike a soldier outa uniform meese replied never seen him around before so what do ya think nomhe looked away nothing wheres he sittingmeese grinned again at kruppes table home ground now aint that finerallick stepped past the woman and headed towards the inn as she moved to follow he held out his hand a minute between us meese he said without turning wheres iriltainside she said behind him good luck nomlucks never free rallick muttered as he turned the corner and climbed the stepshe stood still just within the door and surveyed the crowd a few strangers not enough to cause him concern however his gaze slid across to a man sitting at kruppes table he almost had to take a second look so nondescript was he then rallick strode straight for him the crowd parting as he wentsomething hed never noticed beforeamused he held his eyes on the stranger until he was noticed they locked gazes though the man made no move other than to take a sip from his tankard then set it down carefully on the tablerallick pulled out a chair and dragged it opposite im rallick nomthere was something solid about this person a kind of assurance that was calming rallick felt himself relaxing in spite of his habitual cautionthe mans first words changed that howeverthe eel has a message for you he said quietly direct by word of mouth only before i deliver it though im to give you some backgroundas only i can he paused to drink from the tankard then resumednow turban orr has hired another dozen hunters what are they hunting well me for one your problem is that hes going to be harder to reach the eel approves of your efforts concerning lady sinital colls return is desired by all who value integrity and honour within the council if you require anything ask now and its yoursrallicks eyes had hardened never knew murillio had such a big mouth he saidthe man shook his head your compatriot has revealed nothing nor have you it is the eels business now what do you requirenothinggood the stranger nodded as if hed expected that reply and was pleased incidentally turban orrs efforts to pass the proclamation have been impeded indefinitely the eel wishes to thank you for your unwitting role in that nevertheless the councilman explores other options he has been watched closely hence our fortunate discovery that is at the heart of the eels message to you last night beneath despots barbican turban orr met with a representative of the assassins guildhow he managed that was quite a feat considering how difficult your comrades have been to find in any case a contract was tendered by turban orr the man waited for the shock to wear off rallicks face then continued tendered by turban orr as i said but not on his own behalf rather lady sinital has decided that colls death should be a fact in the real world as it is on paperwho rallick rasped who was the contactim coming to that first it was accepted for the payment was substantial they are aware that coll is presently outside darujhistan they simply await his returnthe assassins nameocelot the man rose the eel wishes you success in all your ventures rallick nom thus the message ends good evening he turned to leavewaityesthank you rallick saidthe stranger smiled then leftthe assassin took the mans seat and leaned against the wall he waved at sulty who had a pitcher of ale and a tankard waiting she hurried over behind her strode at a more leisurely pace irilta and meese they sat down without preamble each with her own tankardeverybodys still breathing irilta said raising her drink and heres t thatmeese lifted hers as well and the two women drank deep then meese bent forward any word of kruppe and the boyrallick shook his head i may not be here when they come back he said tell murillio to go ahead if i dont show and if other events occur and if that happens tell him our mans eyes are open rallick filled his tankard and drained it immediately then he rose dont wish me luck he saidhow about success meese asked a worried expression on her broad facerallick jerked his head in a nod then he left the innanomander rake was hiding something baruk was certain of it as he stared moodily into the fireplace in his right hand was a goblet of goats milk and in his left a large fragment of daru flatbread why had the tiste and permitted the imass to enter the barrow hed asked that question already of the lord sitting beside him but an answer didnt seem forthcoming instead all the alchemist got from rake was that irritating smugness baruk took a bite from the flatbread the crack loud between themrake stretched out his legs and sighed an odd hour to dine he saidall my hours have been odd lately baruk said around the bread he drank a mouthful of milkid no idea that both the shadow lord and oponn had become involved in affairs rake saidbaruk felt the lords eyes on him but he remained staring at the firei had an intimation of oponn he said but nothing definiterake snorted in replybaruk downed some more milk you hold your hunches close to your chest i do the samethis avails us nothing rake snappedthe alchemist turned in his chair to face the tiste and your ravens watched that woman and the tlan imass enter the barrow do you still believe they will faildo you rake retorted i seem to recall that that was your position on the matter baruk as far as i was and am concerned i dont much care whether they succeed or not either way therell be a fight i suspect youd imagined there would be a way to avoid one obviously your intelligence concerning the malazan empire is sorely lacking laseen knows only one thing and thats force shell ignore power until its unveiled and then shell hit you with everything at her disposaland you just wait for it to happen baruk scowled thats how cities are destroyed thats how thousands of people die does any of that matter to you anomander rake so long as you win in the enda tight smile played on the lords thin lips an accurate assessment baruk in this case however laseen wants darujhistan intact i mean to prevent that but destroying the city to defy her would be too easy i could have managed that weeks ago no i want darujhistan to remain as it is yet out of laseens reach that alchemist is victory his grey eyes were on baruk i would not have sought an alliance with you otherwisethe alchemist frowned unless you plan treacheryrake was silent for a time studying his hands clasped on his lap baruk he said soffly as any commander of long standing knows treachery breeds its own once committed whether against an enemy or an ally it become a legitimate choice for everyone in your command from the lowest private seeking promotion to your personal aides bodyguards and officers my people know of our alliance with you alchemist if i were to betray it would not long remain the lord of moons spawn and rightly so baruk smiledand who could challenge your power rakecaladan brood for one rake replied immediately and then theres my four assassin mages even silanah the dweller within the moons caverns might take it upon herself to exact judgement on me i can thintso fear holds you in check son of darknessrake scowled that title is held by those fools who think me worthy of worship i dislike it baruk and would not hear it again from you does fear hold me in check no as powerful as fear is it is no match for what compels me duty the lords eyes had shifted into a dun tone as they remained fixed on his hands which he now turned palms upyou have a duty to your city baruk it drives you shapes you im no stranger to such a thing within moons spawn are the last of the tiste and on this world we are dying alchemist no cause seems great enough to return to my people the zest for life i try but inspiration has never been a great talent of mine even this malazan empire could not make us rise to defend ourselvesuntil we ran out of places to run towe still die on this continent better that it be by the sword he let his hands slip from his lap imagine your spirit dying while your body lives on not for ten years not for fifty but a body that lives on for fifteen twenty thousand yearsrake rose swiftly he looked down upon a silent baruk and smiled a smile that launched a dagger of pain into the alchemists heart thus duty holds me yet a duty that is in itself hollow is it enough to preserve the tiste and simply preserve them do i raise moons spawn into the heavens where we live on beyond any risk any threat what then will i be preserving a history a particular point of view he shrugged the history is done baruk and the tiste and point of view is one of disinterest stoicism and quiet empty despair are these gifts to the world worthy of preservation i think notbaruk had no immediate response what anomander rake had described was almost beyond comprehension yet its anguished cry reached through to the alchemist and yet he said here you are allied with the empires victims do you stand alone in this anomander rake do your people approvethey care not rake said they accept my commands they follow me they serve caladan brood when i ask them to and they die in the mud and forests of a land that is not their own in a war not their own for a people who are terrified of thembaruk sat forward then why why do you do all thisa harsh laugh was rakes response after a moment however his bitter amusement fell away and he said is an honourable cause worth anything these days does it matter that weve borrowed it we fight as well as any man we die alongside them mercenaries of the spirit and even that is a coin we scarcely value why it doesnt matter why but we never betray our alliesi know you are worried that i did nothing to prevent the tlan imass from entering the barrow i believe the jaghut tyrant will be freed baruk but better now with me here beside you than at some other time when the jaghut has no one capable of opposing him well take this legend and carve the life from it alchemist and never again will the threat haunt youbaruk stared at the tiste and are you that certain youll be able to destroy the jaghutno but when it is finished with us it will have been much reduced then it falls to othersto your cabal in fact theres no certainty in this baruk that seems a fact particularly galling to you humans youd better learn to accept it we may well be able to destroy the jaghut tyrant but even this will serve laseens plansthe alchemist was bemused i dont understandrake grinned when we are finished with it we will have been much reduced and then will come the powers of the malazan empire so you see either way she wins if anything has her worried its your torrud cabal baruk of your abilities she knows nothing which is why her agents seek this vorcan the guild master accepting the contract will solve the problem you representyet baruk mused there are other factors involvedoponn rake stated that is a danger to everyone involved do you think oponn cares for a mortal city for its people it is the nexus of power that matters to oponn the whirlwind where games get nasty will immortal blood be spilled thats the question the gods are eager to have answeredbaruk stared down at his goblet of goats milk well at least weve avoided that so far he took a sipwrong rake said forcing shadowthrone out of the game marked the first spilling of immortal bloodbaruk almost choked on the milk he set down the goblet and stared up at the tiste and whosetwo hounds died by my sword knocked shadowthrone somewhat offbalance i believebaruk leaned back and closed his eyes then the stakes have risen he saidas far as moons spawn alchemist rake returned to his chair and sat once again stretching his legs out to the fires warmth now what more can you tell me about this jaghut tyrant i recall you said you wished to consult an authoritybaruk opened his eyes and tossed the flatbread into the fire theres a problem there rake im hoping you can help explain whats happened please he said rising follow megrunting rake climbed back to his feet this night hed not worn his sword to baruk the lords broad back looked incomplete but he was thankful for the weapons absencehe led rake from the room and down the central stairs to the lower chambers the first of these subterranean rooms held a narrow cot and on the cot lay an old man baruk indicated him as you see he appears to be sleeping he is named mammotrake raised an eyebrow the historianalso a high priest of urekthat explains the cynicism in his writings rake said grinning the worm of autumn breeds an unhappy lotbaruk was surprised that this tiste and had read mammots histories but then why not a life spanning twenty thousand years necessitated hobbies he supposedso rake said striding to the bed this mammot sleeps a deep sleep what triggered it he crouched before the old manbaruk joined him that is the odd part i admit to knowing little of earth magic uriss is a warren ive never explored i called on mammot as i indicated to you and upon his arrival i asked him to tell me all he knew of the jaghut tyrant and the barrow he promptly sat down and closed his eyes theyve yet to open and hes not uttered a single word sincerake straightened he took your request seriously i seewhat do you meanas you guessed he opened his uriss warren he sought to answer your question by rather shall we say direct means and now somethings trapped himhe travelled by warren to the jaghut tyrants barrow the old foointo a concentration of tellarm sorcery not to mention jaghut omtose phellack on top of all that a woman with an otataral swordrake crossed his arms hell not come round until both the tlan imass and the otataral have left the barrow and even then if hes not quick the awakening jaghut might take hima chill burgeoned in baruks bones take as in possessionrake nodded his expression grim a high priest is he the jaghut would find him very useful not to mention the access mammot provides to urek do you know baruk if this tyrants capable of enslaving a goddessi dont know baruk whispered sweat trickling down his round face as he stared at mammots recumbent form dessembrae fend he addedthe old woman sitting on the tenement steps squinted at the late afternoon sky while she tamped dried italbe leaves into her steatite pipe on the wooden steps beside her was a small covered bronze brazier thin kindling sticks jutted from holes around the bowl the old woman withdrew one and set it to her pipe then tossed it into the streetthe man walking down the opposite side of the street caught the signal and ran a hand through his hair circle breaker felt near to panicthis taking to the streets was far too risky turban orrs hunters were close to himhe could feel it with dread certainty sooner or later the councilman would recall his many meetings beneath despots barbican and the guard whod been stationed there every time this brazen showing of himself compromised everythinghe turned a corner passing beyond the old womans sight and continued for three blocks until he came opposite the phoenix inn two women lounged by the door laughing at some joke between themcircle breaker tucked his thumbs into his swordbelt and angled the scabbard out to the side its bronzecapped end scraped against the stone wall beside him then he withdrew his hands and continued on his way towards lakefront well its done all that remained for him was one final contact possibly redundant but he would follow the eels ordersthings were coming to a head he did not expect to live much longer but hed do what he must until that time what more could be asked of himat the entrance of the phoenix inn meese nudged irilta thats it she muttered you do the backup this time usual patternirilta scowled then nodded head off thenmeese descended the steps and turned up the street she reversed the route taken by circle breaker until she reached the tenement she saw the old woman still sitting there lazily watching passersby as meese passed through her line of vision the old woman removed the pipe from her mouth and tapped it against the heel of her shoe sparks rained on to the cobblesthat was the signal meese came to the corner of the block then turned right and entered the alley running the buildings length a door opened for her a third of the way down and she strode into a dimly lit room with an open door beyond someone hid behind the first door but she did not acknowledge that someones presence she passed through the second inner door and found herself in a hallway from there it was a quick jog up the stairsapsalaror sorry as she had been known beforehadnt been much impressed by her first sight of darujhistan for some reason despite her excitement and anticipation it had all seemed too familiardisappointed crokus had wasted no time in taking her to his uncles home once theyd stabled colls horse the journey to the city and then through its crowded streets had been for crokus a continual storm of confusion this woman seemed to have a knack for catching him off guard and all he desired now was to throw her into someone elses lap and be done with ityet if that was truly the case why did he feel so miserable about itcrokus left mammots library and returned to the outer room moby chirped and stuck out its red tongue at him from mammots deskignoring the creature crokus stood before apsalar whod seated herself in the better of the two chairshis chair of course i dont understand from the looks of it hes been gone for a couple of days at leastso is that so unusual apsalar asked casuallyit is he grumbled did you feed moby as i askedshe nodded the grapesyes he placed his hands on his hips strange maybe rallick knows something about itwhos rallickan assassin friend crokus replied distractedlyapsalar shot to her feet her eyes widewhats wrong crokus asked stepping close the girl looked positively terrified he glared around half expecting to see some demon rise out of the floor or the cupboard but the room was unchangeda little messier than usual though mobys fault he assumedim not sure she said relaxing with an effort it was as if i was about to remember something but it never cameoh crokus said well we coulda knock sounded on the doorcrokus brightened walking over to it oh he probably lost his keys or something he saidit was unlocked apsalar pointed outcrokus opened the door meese whatre youquiet the big woman hissed pushing past him and shutting the door her gaze fell on apsalar and her eyes widened then she turned back to crokus good i found you lad youve seen no one since getting au backwhy no thats just ita stabler apsalar said frowning up at meese have we metshes lost her memory crokus explained but yes we stabled colls horsewhy meese demanded then as crokus was about to elaborate she went on never mind the stabler shouldnt prove a problem well were in luckdammit meese crokus said whats going onshe met his eyes that darle guard you killed the other night the one in the garden theyve got your name and description lad dont ask me how but the darles are talking high gallows when youre caughtthe blood left crokuss face then his head jerked to apsalar he opened his mouth then shut it again no she truly didnt remember but it must have been her he collapsed into mammots chairweve got to hide you lad meese said both of you i guess but dont you worry crokus me and irilta well take care of you till something can be worked outi dont believe this he whispered staring at the wall opposite him she betrayed me damn hermeese looked questioningly at apsalar who said its a guess but id say a girl named challicemeese closed her eyes briefly challice darle the courts honey these days compassion softened her face as she looked down on crokusoh lad thats the way of it thenhe jerked in the seat and glared up at her it isnt any moremeese grinned right for now she said arms folded over her chest we just sit tight till night then its the rooftops for us dont worry well handle things ladapsalar rose my names apsalar she said pleased to meet you meese and thank you for helping crokusapsalar huh well her grin broadened guess the rooftops will be no problem for you thennone she replied knowing somehow that she was right in thisgood enough meese said now how about we find something to drinkmeese crokus asked do you know where my uncle might have gonecant help you there lad no ideashe wasnt sure about the old woman on the steps but the one immediately below tucked into a shadowed niche and steadily watching the tenement buildingthat one would have to be taken care of it seemed that this coin bearer had protectionserrat was not unduly concerned next to her lord anomander rake she ranked the deadliest among the tiste and of moons spawnfinding this boyservant of oponns had not proved difficult once her lord had given her the necessary details oponns magical signature had been easy to find it helped that shed encountered it beforeand from this very boyon the rooftops two weeks past her agents had chased the coin bearer that night abandoning him once hed entered the phoenix innbut only at her command if shed suspected then what she now knew oponns presence would have ended that very nightill luck serrat smiled to herself taking a more comfortable position on the rooftop theyd move at night she suspected as for the woman hiding below shed have to be removed indeed with a spell of bluffing and enough in the way of shadows she might as easily take the womans placethered be no suspicion from the other woman then the one presently inside with the coin bearer serrat nodded yes that would be how shed play itbut for now shed wait patience ever rewardswell murillio said as he scanned the crowd theyre not here which means theyre with mammotkruppe drew a deep breath of the sweaty smoky air ah civilization kruppe believes your assessment is accurate friend if so then we might as well rest here drinking and supping for an hour or two with that he strode into the phoenix inna few old hands seated at kruppes table gathered their tankards and pitcher and left murmuring apologies and grinning among themselveskruppe gave them a gracious nod and settled with a loud sigh into his usual chair murillio paused at the bar and spoke with scurve then he joined kruppebrushing dust from his shirt murillio frowned distractedly at his roadweary condition i look forward to a bath he said apparently scurve saw rallick in here earlier talking with some stranger since then nobodys seen himkruppe waved an uninterested hand kind sulty arrives he announced a moment later a pitcher of ale stood on the table kruppe wiped his tankard with his silk handkerchief then filled it with the foaming brewwerent we supposed to report to baruk murillio asked his eyes on his friendall in due time kruppe said first we must recover from our ordeals what if kruppe were to lose his voice in very midsentence of said report what would avail baruk of that he raised his tankard and drank deepmurillio drummed the fingers of one hand restlessly on the table his eyes constantly scanning the crowd then he straightened in his seat he filled his tankard so now that you know what rallick and i are up to he said what do you plan to do about itkruppes eyebrows lifted kruppe why nothing but good of course timely assistance and such no need for blatant fretting friend murillio by all means proceed as planned think of wise kruppe as no more than a kindly chaperonhoods breath murillio groaned eyes rolling we were doing fine without your help the best thing you could do for us is stay out of our way dont get involvedand abandon my friends to the fates nonsensemurillio finished his ale and rose im going home he said you can make the report to baruk in a weeks time for all i care and when rallick finds out you know all about our plans well kruppe id hate to be in your bootskruppe waved dismissively see sulty yon upon her tray is kruppes supper rallick noms nasty daggers and nastier temper pale to insignificance before such repast as now approaches goodnight to you then murillio until the morrowmurillio stared down at him then grumbled goodnight kruppehe left the bar through the kitchen door as soon as he stepped into the back alley a figure accosted him from across the way murillio frowned that you rallickno the shadowed figure said fear me not murillio i have a message to you from the eel call me circle breaker the man strode closer the message concerns councilman turban orrrallick moved from rooftop to rooftop in the darkness the need for absolute silence slowed his hunt considerably thered be no conversation with ocelot rallick expected hed have but one shot at the manif he missed his chance his clan leaders sorcery would prove the deciding factor unlessrallick paused and checked his pouch years back the alchemist baruk had rewarded him for work well done with a small bag of reddish dust baruk had explained its magicdeadening properties but rallick resisted placing his trust in the powder had its potency survived the years was it a match for ocelots powers there was no tellinghe crossed a high rooftop skirting the edge of a dome off to his right and below was the citys eastern wall the faint glow of worrytown rose beyond it the assassin suspected that ocelot would await colls arrival at worry gate hiding within crossbow range better to kill the man before he entered the citythis limited the possibilities considerably lines of sight were few and krul hill was the best of them still ocelot might well have used sorcery already and lie hidden from mundane eyes rallick might stumble right over himhe reached the north side of the domes skirt before him rose the krul temple from the belfry thered be a clean shot just as coll entered the gate rallick removed the pouch from his bag whatever the dust covered baruk had said would be impervious to magic more it had an area effect the assassin scowled how much of an area and did it wear off most importantly baruk had saidand rallick remembered this clearlydo not let it touch your skin poison hed asked no the alchemist had replied the powder changes some people there is no predicting such changes however best not to take the chance rallicksweat trickled down his face finding ocelot was already a slim chance colls death would ruin everything and more it would strip from rallick his last claim to what to humanity the price of failure had become very high justice he hissed angrily it has to mean something it has torallick untied the pouch he dipped into it and scraped out a handful of the powder he rubbed it between his fingers it felt like rust thats it he wondered maybe it had deteriorated shrugging he began to massage it into his skin starting with his face what changes he muttered i dont feel any changesreaching under his clothing as much as was possible rallick used up the last of the powder the pouch itself was stained on the inside he turned it inside out then stuffed it into his belt now he grimaced the hunt continues somewhere out there an assassin waited eyes fixed on jammits worry road ill find you ocelot he whispered his eyes fixed on kruls belfry tower and magic or no magic you wont hear me you wont even feel my breath on your neck until its too late i swear ithe began his ascentchapter eighteenthis blue city hides under its cloak a hidden hand that holds like stone a blade envenomed by the eight limbed paraltthe sting brings death in the span of grief that marks a final breathso this hand defies sorcerys web and trembles the gossamer strand of a spiders deadly threatthis hand beneath the blue citys cloak drives home powers gentle balancethe conspiracy blind gallan bsergeant whiskeyjack strode to the bedside you sure youre up to it he asked kalamthe assassin sitting with his back against the wall glanced up from honing his long knives not much choice is there he returned to his sharpeningwhiskeyjacks expression was drawn and haggard from lack of gleep he looked across the small room to where quick ben crouched in the corner a fragment of bedroll was clutched in the wizards hands and his eyes were closedat the table fiddler and hedge had dismantled their massive arbalestthey now sat cleaning and examining each piece they were looking at a fight ahead of themwhiskeyjack shared their conviction each hour that passed brought their many hunters that much closer of those it was the tiste and he feared the most his squad was good but not that goodby the window was trotts leaning against the wall with his burly arms crossed and against one wall slept mallet his snores loud in the roomthe sergeant returned his attention to kalam its a long shot isnt it the assassin nodded no reason for the man to keep showing himself they got burned the last time he shrugged ill try the inn again if anything someone will mark me and the guild will come if i can get a word in before they kill me theres a chance its not much but itll have to do whiskeyjack finished youve got tomorrow if we draw a blank he looked over to fiddler and hedge and found their eyes on him we detonate the intersections do damage hurt themthe two saboteurs grinned their anticipationquick bens loud hiss of frustration brought everyone round the wizards eyes had opened he tossed the torn cloth contemptuously on to the floor no good sergeant he said cant find sorry anywherekalam rumbled a curse and thrust his weapons into their scabbardsso what does that mean whiskeyjack asked the wizardmost likely quick ben said shes dead he gestured at the cloth with that theres no way the rope could hide from me not while still possessing sorrymaybe once you told him youd figured him out fiddler said he tossed in his coins and quit the gamequick ben made a face the rope isnt scared of us fiddler come back to earth if anything hed be coming down on us shadowthrone mustve told him by now who i am or rather who i once was its not the ropes business but shadowthrone might insist gods dont like being cheated especially being cheated twice he climbed to his feet and stretched the kinks from his back he met whiskeyjacks gaze i dont understand this sergeant im stumpeddo we abandon her whiskeyjack askedquick ben nodded might as well he paused then stepped forward we were all wishing we were wrong about her he said but what sorry did had nothing to do with being human and as far as im concerned im glad of thatid hate to think kalam said from the bed that evil was real that it existed with a face as plain as the next mans i know whiskeyjack youve got your reasons for wanting it that wayquick ben moved closer to the sergeant his gaze softening keeps you sane every time you order somebody to die he said we all know about that sergeant and wed be the last to suggest theres some other way that maybe you havent thought of yetwell im glad to hear it whiskeyjack growled he surveyed everyone in the room seeing that mallet was awake and watching himanybody else got something to sayi have fiddler said then ducked at the sergeants glower well you asked didnt youout with it thenfiddler straightened in his chair and cleared his throat hedge poked him in the ribs as he was about to begin after a menacing scowl he tried again its like this sergeant weve seen a hell of a lot of our friends die right and maybe we didnt have to give the orders so maybe you think its easier for us but i dont think so you see to us those people were living breathing they were friends when they die it hurts but you go around telling yourself that the only way to keep from going mad is to take all that away from them so you dont have to think about it so you dont have to feel anything when they die but damn when you take away everybody elses humanity you take away your own and thatll drive you mad as sure as anything its that hurt we feel that makes us keep going sergeant and maybe were not getting anywhere but at least were not running away from anythingthere was silence in the room then hedge punched fiddler in the arm ill be damned you got a brain in there after all i guess i been wrong about you all these yearsyeah right fiddler said rolling his eyes at mallet and who is it whos burned his hair off so many times hes gotta wear some ugly leather cap all the time heymallet laughed but the tension remained and everyones gaze swung back to fix on their sergeant slowly whiskeyjack studied each man in his squad he saw the caring in their eyes the open offer to the friendship hed spent years suppressing all that time pushing them away pushing everyone away and the stubborn bastards just kept on coming backso sorry hadnt been human his conviction that all shed done was within the possibilities of humanity now seemed to rest on uncertain ground but it did not collapse hed seen too much in his life thered be no sudden faith in his view of human history no burgeoning optimism to chase away all the demonic memories of the hells hed lived throughnil still there came a time when some denials lost their function when the worlds relentless battering at him made his foolishness obvious even to himself he was finally and after all these years among friends that was a hard admission and he realized he was already impatient with itall right he growled enough with the flapping lips weve got work to do corporalsergeant kalam repliedget yourself ready youve got the daylight hours to reestablish contact with the assassins guild meanwhile i want everyone else to lay out their weapons and give them a good cleaning repairs to armourtherell be an inspection and if i find a single damn thing i dont like therell be hell coming down understoodwe hear ya mallet said grinninged i ed ie ilk tre go to e en s a ain ed ism k despite their slow pace colls wound had opened half a dozen times since theyd begun the journey hed found a way of sitting in his saddle leaning to one side and taking most of the weight on his uninjured leg and since this morning the wound had yet to reopen the awkward position brought pains and cramps to the rest of him howeverparan knew a foul mood when he saw one though it was clear to both of them that a bond had formed between them comfortable and unfettered by pretences theyd exchanged but scant words as the ravages of colls wound continued to take its tollcolls entire left leg from the hip where the sword had done its damage down to the foot was a uniform sundarkened brown colourclots of drying blood gathered in the joints of his upper leg plates and knee guard as the thigh swelled they were forced to slice the leather padding beneath the platesuccour had been denied them at the catlin bridge garrison since the lone surgeon stationed there had been sleeping off one of his bad nightsclean bandages had been donated though and it was thesealready soaked throughthat now covered the woundthere was little traffic on jammits worry despite the citys walls being within sight the flood of refugees from the north had since ended and those who would gather for the gedderone festival had already done soas they approached the edge of worrytown coll raised himself from the semiconscious state hed been in for the last few hours his face was deathly white is this worry gate he asked dullyi believe so paran said since they were on the road sharing that strange name will we be permitted to pass within he asked will they call for a surgeoncoll shook his head take me on through phoenix inn take me to the phoenix inn his head sagged againvery well coll hed be surprised if the guards permitted it and hed need a story to tell them though coll had said nothing of how hed been wounded i hope he muttered theres someone in this phoenix inn with a healers touch the man looked bad paran fixed his gaze on the citys gates hed already seen enough to understand why the empress wanted it so avidly darujhistan he sighed my but you are a wonder arent yourallick nudged himself another inch upward his limbs trembled with exhaustion if not for the morning shadows on this side of the belfry hed have been spotted long ago as it was he would not remain hidden much longertaking the stairs would have been suicide in the darkness ocelot would have set alarms all along the waythe man was no fool at covering the approaches to his positionif he was up there rallick reminded himself if not coll was in trouble there was no telling if his friend had arrived at the gates yet and the silence from the top of the belfry could mean anything he paused to rest and glanced up ten feet to go the most critical ones yet he was so tired it was all he could do simply to retain the handholds the silent approach was now beyond him his only advantage lay in that ocelots concentration would be eastward while he now climbed the west side of the towerhe drew some deep breaths then reached for another handholdpassersby stopped to watch paran and coll move slowly through worrytown towards the gate ignoring them and the questions they asked the captain focused his attention on the two guards at the gate itself theyd spotted him and coll and now stood waitingreaching the gate paran motioned that they would pass through one guard nodded while the other walked alongside the captains horseyour friend needs a surgeon he said if you wait just inside we can have one here in five minutesparan refused the offer we need to find the phoenix inn im from the north never been here before the man said the phoenix inn so thats where im going to take himthe guard was dubious be surprised if hed make it that far but if thats what you want the least we can do is give you an escortas they emerged from the gates shadow the other guard cried out in surpriseparan held his breath as the man stepped close to coll i know him he said hes coll jhamin of house jhamin i served under him what i thought coll died a few years back the other guard said screw the writs his companion snapped i know what i know vildron this is coll all righthe wants to go to the phoenix inn paran told the man thats the the man nodded lets do it right though he turned to the other guard ill take the grief if theres any vildron get me the wagonits still hitched up from this morning right the guard smiled up at paran thanks for getting him here some of us in the city still got eyes and damn what the highbrows whisper well put him in the back of theparan relaxed thanks soldier he looked past the man eager to see what he could of the city now that the wall was behind him immediately before them rose a humped hill its sides overgrown with weeds and gnarled trees on its summit squatted a temple of some kind abandoned long ago from which a squaresided tower rose capped by a bronze a a rnnf ashis e es reached the belfrys opensided platform he saw a rallick raised his head cautiously over the platforms edge he almost gasped aloud the belfry was empty then he remembered ocelots sorcery holding his breath he strained one last time with leaden arms drawing himself flat on to the platform as soon as he moved to gather in his feet the barren stone of the platform shimmered and he saw ocelot lying before him crossbow cocked taking aim at something rallick unsheathed his knives and moved all at once but his ex ocelot spun on to his back weapon swinging to fix on rallick the clan leaders face twisted into a mask of rage and fear he wasted no time with words and immediately released the quarrel set in his cross rallick tensed for the impact that he was certain would throw him across the platform and possibly over the edge a flash of red before his chest blinded him momentarily but no impact came blinking rallick looked down the quarrel had vanished the truth came to him in an instant the quarrel had been magic created by sorcery to fly unimpeded but baruks rusty powder had worked even as this thought burst ocelot swore and dropped the crossbow as he reached for his knife rallick landed on him a loud grunt sounded from the clan leader his eyes squeezing shut in painampakywv axwwampt xaggm n v figwharia against ocelots chest the weapon scraped across mail beneath the cloth shirt damn the man had learned something from that other nightand this was rallicks own precaution come to defy him now the blade in his left hand he angled upward under ocelots right arm the weapons point cut into flesh then continued on into the mans armpitrallick saw inches from his face the daggers tip emerge from the cloth covering ocelots right shoulder followed by a bloom of blood he heard a knife skitter across the flagstonesteeth bared ocelot snapped his left hand up to the back of rallicks neck finding his braid he gave it a savage yank twisting rallicks head around then he tried to sink his teeth into rallicks neckocelot gasped as rallick jammed a knee into his crotch he tightened his hold on the braid again this time near its knotted endrallick heard the snick of metal and attempted desperately to roll to his right wounded as ocelots right arm was it struck his body with enough force to drive the wedged wristblade through the chain links and into his chest a dull fire blossomed from the wound ocelot jerked the blade free and still holding rallicks braid drew back for another stabrallick brought up his right arm and in a single sweeping motion sliced through his braid freed he pushed himself on to that side withdrawing the knife in his left hand as he did so ocelot slashed wildly at his face missing by incheswith all the remaining strength in his left arm rallick slammed his knife into ocelots stomach links snapped and the blade sank to its hiltthe clan leaders body doubled up curling around the embedded weapon gasping rallick lurched forward and hammered the other dagger into ocelots foreheadrallick lay unmoving for a time wondering at the absence of painthe plan would fall to murillio now coll would be avenged murillio could handle ithe had no choiceocelots body seemed to grow heavier on him despite the blood ing from it id always believed i was this mans match he muttered he pushed himself from the stilltwitching body and rolled on to his back in the centre of the platform hed hoped to see sky to look one last time on its bright depthless blue instead he found himself looking at the underside of the belfrys roof its ancient stone arch crowded with nesting bats this detail fixed itself in his head as he felt the blood stream from his chest he thought he could see beady eyes glittering down at himafter seeing no other sign of movement on the belfry parans gaze swung to the avenue on his left vildron approached seated on a wagon drawn by two horses the guard waiting beside colls horse said give me a hand here will you lets get the old man downparan dismounted and hurried to help him he glanced at colls facethough still hunched on the saddle he was unconscious how much longer could he last if that was me paran realized id be dead by nowafter all this he growled as they dragged coll from the saddle youd damn well better livegroaning serrat rolled on to her back the sun beat down hot against her eyelids as the scattered fragments of her memory gathered the tiste and had been about to make her move on the woman in the alley below with that one dead the coin bearers protectors would number but one and when they left the tenement block under cover of darkness theyd walk right into the trap shed setthe assassinmage opened her eyes to a midmorning sun overheadher daggers which shed held in her hands as she crouched at the rooftops edge now lay on the pebbled surface beside her neatly placed side by side a thick dull ache throbbed in the back of her skull she probed the wound wincing then sat upthe world spun then settled serrat was bewildered and angry shed been blindsided and whoever had done it was good good enough to sneak up on a tiste and assassinmage and that was worrying since theyd yet to meet such a match in darujhistan with the exception of those two claw on the night of the ambush but if it had been the claw shed be dead nowinstead the arrangements looked to have been designed more with embarrassment in mind than anything else leaving her here in broad daylight weapons beside her hinted of a subtle and cunning sense of humour oponn possibly though gods rarely acted so directly preferring unwitting agents culled from among the mortal massesone certainty rose from the mystery however and that was that shed lost her opportunity to kill the coin bearerat least for another daynext time she vowed as she climbed to her feet and accessed her kurald galain warren her secret foes would find her ready for themthe air around her shimmered with sorcery when it settled serrat was gonemotes of dust drifted through the dead hot air of the phoenix inns atticthe slanting ceiling rose from five feet along the east wall to seven feet along the west wall sunlight streamed in from windows at each end of the long and narrow roomboth crokus and apsalar slept though at opposite ends of the roomsitting on a crate beside the trap door meese cleaned her nails with a sliver of wood leaving mallets tenement and making their way across the rooftops to this hiding place had proved an easy task too easy in fact irilta reported that no one on the streets had followed them and the rooftops themselves had been empty of life it was as if a path free of obstruction had been made for themmore of the eels brilliance at work meese grunted softly maybemore likely meese was putting too much weight on the instinctive unease that travelled like an elusive itch along her spine even now she felt hidden eyes upon them and that she told herself glaring around the musty attic was impossiblethere came a soft knock at the trapdoor the door swung up and irilta appeared meese she whispered loudlybreathing down your neck meese rumbled tossing the wood sliver on to the oily floor tell scurve this place is a fire waiting to happenirilta grunted as she pulled herself into the room she shut the trap door and wiped the dust from her hands getting strange downstairs she said city wagon rolls up and off comes a guard and some other fellow carrying coll between them the old fools neardead from a sword cut they put him in kruppes room a floor down sultys run off to find a cutter but it dont look good not good at allmeese squinted in the dusty air her gaze fixing on crokus where he still slept whats the other one look like she askedirilta grinned good enough for a roll on the mat id say said he found coll on jammits worry bleeding all over the place coll woke up long enough to tell him to ride here the guys downstairs in the bar right now eating enough for three menmeese grunted foreigneririlta strode to the window facing the street speaks daru like he was born to it but he said hed come down from the north pale genabaris before that hes got the soldier about him id sayany word from the eel yetwe keep the lad here for nowand the girlthe samemeese sighed loudly crokus aint gonna like being cooped up hereirilta glared over at crokuss sleeping form was the lad truly asleepno choice got word that theres a couple of guardsmen waiting at mammots placetoo late of course but theyve got damn close irilta rubbed dust from the window and leaned forward sometimes i swear i see someone or maybe something then i blink and its goneknow what you mean bones creaking meese pushed herself to her feet i think even the eels beginning to sweat she chuckled lifes heating up friend rolling times aheadirilta nodded grimly roll on roll oncaptain paran refilled his tankard for the third time was this what that tiste and had meant about his luck turning since coming to this land hed found three friendssomething wholly unexpected and new to him precious in fact but the tattersail he knew was dead and in her place a child toc was dead and now it looked like coll would join that listhe ran a finger through a pool of spilled beer on the table creating a river leading to a crack between two planks then watched as the beer drained down and out of sight he felt a spreading wetness on his right shin but ignored it as his eyes focused on the crack the wood had been bolted down joining the thick planks to an equally robust frame of legswhat had rake said paran rose and unclipped his sword belt he laid it on the table then withdrew chancethe few regulars in the bar fell silent and turned to watch him behind the counter scurve reached for his clubthe captain noticed none of this with the sword in his right hand he set the point into the crack and brought the weapon vertical working it back and forth he managed to drive it close to half its length between the planks then he sat down again and reached for his beereveryone relaxed and spoke among themselves in shared confusionparan swallowed a mouthful of beer frowning at chance what had rake said when your luck turns break the sword or give it to your worst enemy he doubted oponn would accept it however and that meant breaking it the sword had been with him for a long time hed used it in battle only once and that had been against the houndfaintly he heard the words of one of his childhood tutors the mans lined face rose into his thoughts to accompany the voice those whom the gods choose tis said they first separate from other mortalsby treachery by stripping from you your spirits lifeblood the gods will take all your loved ones one by one to their death and as you harden as you become what they seek the gods smile and nod each company you shun brings you closer to them tis the shaping of a tool son the prod and pull and the final succour they offer you is to end your lonelinessthe very isolation they helped you create never get noticed boyhad the shaping begun paran scowled was he responsible for taking colls life the mere brush of friendship between themenough to seal the mans doom oponn he whispered youve a lot to answer for and answer for it you shallhe set down the tankard and rose then he reached for the swordclimbing the steps of the phoenix inn kalam paused damn there it was again this feeling that unseen eyes were fixed on him the sensation born of his claw training had struck him four times in quick succession since hed come within sight of this bar heeding such warnings was what kept him alive and yet he felt no malice in that unwanted attentionrather it had the feel of amused curiosity as if whoever watched him knew full well who and what he was yet seemed unconcernedhe shook himself then entered the bar as soon as he took his first step into the heavy stagnant atmosphere kalam knew that something was wrong he shut the door behind him waited for his eyes to adjust to the gloom he heard breathing the light scuff of furniture and clank of tankards coming to rest on tabletops so there were people here then why the silenceas the grey confines of the bar grew defined he saw that its denizens had turned their backs to him and were watching a man standing behind his table at the far end of the room the lantern light reflected dully from a sword thrust through the table and the man had closed one hand around its grip he seemed oblivious to everyone else in the barkalam took a halfdozen steps coming to the near end of the counterhis dark eyes remained on the man with the sword and a frown deepened the lines on his broad flat forehead the assassin stopped was it a trick of this damn light he wondered no he said startling the innkeeper behind the counter it isnt he pushed himself back from the counter ran his eyes over the others in the chamberall locals hed have to take the riska band of tension tightened around kalams neck and shoulders as he strode directly for the man who looked to be but moments away from snapping his swords blade the assassin plucked an empty chair from a table in his path and slammed it down onehanded opposite the manstartled eyes fixed on kalamyour godgiven lucks holding captain the assassin rumbled in low close tones sit downhis expression confused and frightened paran released his grip on the weapon and sank back into his seatkalam followed suit and leaned forward over the table whats all this drama anyway he asked in a whisperthe captain frowned who are youbehind them conversations resumed loud with rattled nerve aint you guessed kalam wagged his head corporal kalam ninth squad bridgeburners the last time i saw you you was recovering from parans hands shot out and gripped kalams shirt the assassin was too surprised to react and the cantains words confused him all the more is your squads healer still alive corporalwhat alive yeah sure why not whatsshut up paran snapped just listen soldier bring him here now no questions im giving you a direct order corporal he releasedkalam almost saluted but caught himself in time as you command paran glared at the corporals back until the man disappeared through the front door then he surged to his feet innkeeper he called stepping around the table the black man will be showing up in a few minutes with company send them up to colls room on the double understood paran strode to the stairs as he reached them he glanced back at the sword and nobody touch that sword he ordered swinging a glare across everyone in the room nobody seemed inclined to challenge himwith a sharp satisfied nod the captain ascended the stairson the first floor he strode down the hallway to the last room on the right he entered without knocking to find sulty and a local surgeon sitting at the rooms lone table colls blanketcovered form a un the surgeon rose its no good he said in a thin reedy voice the aye the surgeon replied but it wont be for much longer if the wound had been further down on his leg i might have been able to cut it off even then im afraid the poisons spread through all of him im what do i owe you for the services the captain asked rememberingthe surgeon frowned over at sulty why nothing sir i failed he left sulty joined the captain at the bedside she wiped her face as she looked down on coll but said nothing a few minutes later she too left the room unable to remain any longerparan found a stool and pulled it over to the bed he sat and leaned his forearms on his knees he was not sure how long he sat there staring down at the strawlittered floor but the door slamming open behind him brought him to his feeta bearded man stood in the doorway his slategrey eyes hard and coldare you mallet paran demandedthe man shook his head and strode inside behind him appeared kalam and another man the latters gaze found coll and he walked quickly to the bedim sergeant whiskeyjack the bearded man said quietly pardon my directness sir but what the hell are you doing hereignoring the question paran joined the healer mallet laid a hand over the crusted bandages he glared up at the captain cant you smell the rot hes gone mallet frowned and leaned forward no wait damn i dont believe it the healer took a spoonshaped blade from his pouch and removed the bandages then he began to dig into the wound with the blade shedenuls mercy someones stuffed this with herbs he drove his fingers into the woundcoll jerked and moanedmallet grinned hah that got you going did it good he probed deeper this cuts halfway through the bone he breathed in amazement those damn herbs have poisoned his marrow who the hell treated this he asked looking accusingly at parani dont know paran saidall right mallet said removing his hand and wiping it on the blankets move back everybody give me some room a minute later captain and this man wouldve been striding through hoods gate he pressed his hand down on colls chest and closed his eyes and be glad im as good as i amnow captainparan walked over to the table and motioned for the sergeant to join him first has adjunct lorn contacted you yetwhiskeyjacks blank look was sufficient answergood im in time then paran glanced up at kalam who had stationed himself behind the sergeant youve been set up the plan was to take the city yes but also to make certain you were all killed in the processwhiskeyjack held up a hand a moment sir you and tattersail worked this outparan closed his eyes briefly shes dead chasing hairlock out on the rhivi plain tayschrenn got to her it was also her intent to find you and tell you all that im telling you im afraid i wont be her equal as your ally once the adjunct shows up but at least i can prepare you somewhatkalam spoke i dont like the idea of oponns pawn supposedly helping usparan nodded i have it on good authority that im not oponns that sword downstairs is though your squad wizard should be able to confirm thisthe adjuncts plan whiskeyjack reminded him the fingers of one hand tapping slowly on the tabletopshell have no trouble finding you she has a talent in that area but i fear shes not the major threat theres a tlan imass with her maybe her mission is simply to lead him to you then hell handle the restkalam cursed and began pacing behind the sergeants chairwhiskeyjack reached a decision the satchel corporalthe assassin frowned then picked up the sergeants standardissue supply satchel left beside the door he returned and set it down on the tabletopwhiskeyjack released the straps and pulled out an object wrapped in burgundy silk he removed the cloth revealing twin yellowed bones of a human forearm the elbowends ball joints were bound together with verdigrised copper wire the wrist ends were wrapped as well but as a misshapen knife grip beyond which jutted a serrated bladewhat is it the captain asked ive never seen its like beforebe surprised if you had whiskeyjack said back in the days of the emperor the inner ring of military commanders each possessed one of these the booty of a looted kchain chemalle tomb he grasped the bones with both hands it was the source of much of our success captain he rose and drove the point into the tablea flash of white light erupted from the bones then contracted to a swirl spinning threadlike between them paran heard a voice he knewi was getting worried whiskeyjack high fist dujek growledunavoidable the sergeant replied frowning at paran weve had little to report until now but i need to know the situation in pale high fistyou want an update before you spill the bad news eh fair enough dujek said tayschrenns stumbling in circles he was last happy when bellurdan was killed along with tattersail two more of the old guard gone in one fell swoop since then all hes got is questions what game is oponn playing was there truly a clash between the knight of darkness and shadowthrone did a soulshifted puppet kidnap torture then murder a claw officer in nathilog and what truths were revealed by the poor manwe were not aware that hairlock had done that high fisti believe you whiskeyjack in any case enough of the empresss plans have been discovered and indeed she seems convinced that the dismantling of my army will pull me back under her wing in time to saddle me with the command of the seven cities garrisons and put a bloody stop to the rebellion thats brewing she seriously miscalculated thereif only shed paid attention to toc the youngers reports well laseens intentions now seem to be riding on adjunct lorn and onos toolan theyve reached the jaghut barrow whiskeyjackmallet joined them and met kalams stunned gaze clearly even theyd had no idea that their sergeant was so well informed suspicion dawned in the assassins eyes and paran nodded to himself it was happening after alldujek continued the moranth black are ready to march but its only for show and to get them out of the city so what are we looking at friend the balance of the world is with you in darujhistan if lorn and onos toolan succeed in unleashing the tyrant on the city you can be certain that you and your squad are intended to be on the casualty listcloser to home heres what you want were ready to move tayschrenn himself will trigger events when he announces the disbanding of the bridgeburnersthe blind idiot now im waitinghigh fist whiskeyjack began captain parans made it hes sitting across from me right now his story is that oponns working through his sword not him he met the captains eyes i believe himdujek spoke captainyes high fistwas toc any helpparan winced he gave his life for this high fist the puppet hairlock ambushed us tossed toc into aa rent or somethingthere was silence then dujek said his voice hoarse im sorry to hear that captain more than you know his father well enough of that go on whiskeyjackno success yet in contacting the local assassins guild high fist weve mined the intersections though ill be explaining everything to my men tonight the question remains what to do about captain paran understood dujek replied captain paransirhave you come to any conclusions paran glanced at whiskeyjack yes sir i think soso what choice will you make captainhe ran a hand through his hair and leaned back in the chair high fist he said slowly tayschrenn killed tattersail and failed but that is a secret i will keep to myself the adjuncts plan included betraying her word to me and probably killing me in the process but i admit thats secondary to what tayschrenn did looking up he met whiskeyjacks steady gaze tattersail took care of me and i her after that hound it he hesitated  it meant something high fist he straightenedso i gather you intend to defy the empress but what then do we challenge the empires hundred legions with ten thousand men do we proclaim an independent kingdom and wait for laseen to make an example of us i need more details high fist before i decide whether i join you because sir i want vengeancedujek responded the empress loses genabackis captain weve got the support for that by the time the malazan marines arrive to reinforce the campaign itll already be over the crimson guard wont even let them disembark expect nathilog to rise up and genabaris to follow the moranth alliance is about to lose its punchthough im afraid i cant give you the details on thatmy plans captain they might not make sense because i dont have time to explain but were readying ourselves to take on a new player in the gamesomeone completely outside all of this and that someone is damn nasty he is called the pannion seer who even now prepares his armies for a holy war you want vengeance leave tayschrenn to enemies closer to home as for lorn shes all yours if you can manage it i cant offer you anything more captain you can say no nobody will kill you for thatparan stared at his hands i want to know when high mage tayschrenn gets what he deservesagreedvery well high fist as far as this present situation is concerned however id rather sergeant whiskeyjack remained in commanddujek asked a grin in his voice whiskeyjackaccepted the sergeant answered he smiled at paran welcome aboard captainenough dujek askedwell speak again after its all done whiskeyjack said until then high fist successsuccess whiskeyjackthe threads of light faded as soon as they were gone kalam rounded on his sergeant you old bastard fiddler told me dujek wouldnt hear any talk of revolt not only that the high fist told you to walk after this missionwhiskeyjack shrugged removing the strange contraption from the table things change corporal when dujek got the adjuncts word on next years reinforcements it became obvious that someone was ensuring that the genabackan campaign would end in disaster now even dujek wont tolerate that obviously plans would have to be revised he faced paran his eyes hardening im sorry captain but lorn has to livebut the high fistwhiskeyjack shook his head shes on her way into the city assuming that she and the imass succeed in freeing the jaghut the tyrant will need a reason to come to darujhistan and we can only assume that somehow lorn will be that reason she will find us captain once that happens well decide whats to be done with her depending on what she tells usif you challenge her openly she will kill you if necessary she will have to die but her demise will be subtle do you have problems with any of thisparan released a long breath can you at least explain why you went ahead and mined the cityin a moment whiskeyjack said rising first he said whos the wounded mannot wounded any more mallet said grinning at paran just sleepingparan also rose in that case ill also explain everything just let me go downstairs and retrieve my sword at the door he paused and turned to whiskeyjack one more thing wheres your recruit sorrykalam answered missing we know what she is captain do youyes but she may not be what she once was assuming shadowthrone didnt lie he thought to relate that part of his story then dismissed the notion he couldnt be sure after all better to wait and seethe burial chamber proved to be a small nondescript beehive tomb the low dome constructed of roughly dressed stones the passageway leading to it was narrow and less than four feet high sloping slightly downwards the chambers floor was of packed earth and in its centre rose a circular wall of stones capped by a single massive lintel stonefrostcrusted objects lay on this flat surfacetool swung to the adjunct the object you seek is called a finnest within it is stored the jaghut tyrants powers it is perhaps best described as a selfcontained omtose phellack warren he will discovcr it is missing once fully awakened and will unerringly hunt it down n slowly approached lorn blew on her numb hands the d the lintel stone and while its in my possession she askedyour otataral sword will deaden its aura not completely the finnest should not remain in your hands for long adjunctshe scanned the objects scattered on the stone surface the imass joined her lorn picked up a scabbarded knife then discarded it in this tool could not help her she had to rely upon her own senses honed by the strange unpredictable effects of the otataral a mirror set in an antler caught her eye the mica surface was latticed in a web of frost yet it seemed to glimmer with a light of its own she reached for it then hesitated beside it almost lost among the crystalline frost was a small round object it lay upon a flap of hide lorn frowned then picked it upas its ice coating melted she saw that it was not perfectly round she polished the blackened surface and studied it closelyi believe it is an acorn tool saidlorn nodded and its the finnest her gaze fell to the capped mound of rocks what an odd choicethe imass shrugged in a clatter of bones the jaghut are odd peopletool they werent very warlike were they i mean before your kind sought to destroy themthe imass was slow to reply even then he said at last the key lay in making them angry for then they destroyed indiscriminately including their ownlorn shut her eyes briefly she pocketed the finnest lets get out of hereyes adjunct even now the jaghut tyrant stirschapter nineteenbut someone died here alas who drinks of this now and then and stirs the ashes of thine own pyremaker of paths you were never so thirsty in

tiste and tensed as the window in the attic beneath her creaked inward on rusty hinges knowing herself to be invisible she leaned forwardthe lads head popped out he glanced at the alley below the opposite rooftops and those to either side then he looked up his gaze passed right through serrat and she smiledit hadnt taken long to find him again his only company she could sense was a young woman whose aura was harmless astonishingly innocent the other two women no longer occupied the attic excellentit would be that much easier she stepped back as the coin bearer climbed through the windowa moment later he scrambled on to the sloping rooftopserrat decided that she would waste no time even as the coin bearer pushed himself to his feet she sprang forwardher charge met an invisible hand driving into her chest with bonejarring force it pushed her back through the air giving a final shove that sent her cartwheeling beyond the roofs edge her spells of invisibility and flight remained with her even when she rebounded off a brick chimney dazed and driftingapsalar appeared on the roofs edge crokus crouched before her daggers in hand and glaring all around him whats wrong she whispered frightenedslowly crokus relaxed and turned a rueful grin her way just nerves he said thought i saw something felt a wind looked like well never mind he looked around again theres nothing here come on thenwheres this new hidingplace of yours aspalar asked as she gained the rooftophe faced east and pointed to the shadowed hills rising on the other side of the wall up there he said right under their very nosesmurillio clasped on his swordbelt the longer he waited for rallick to arrive the more certain he was that ocelot had killed his friend the only question that remained was whether coll still lived maybe rallick had done enough wounded ocelot sufficiently to prevent the clan master from completing the contract i can hope anywaytheyd know at the phoenix inn and each minute that passed made his spartan room seem smaller more cramped if coll lived murillio vowed to attempt rallicks role in the plan he checked his rapier itd been years since his last duel and turban orr was said to be the citys best his chances looked poorhe collected his cape and fastened the collar around his neck and who was this circle breaker with all the devastating news how did this eel justify involving himself or herself in their schemes murillios eyes narrowed was it possible that little round runt of a manhe pulled on his doeskin gloves muttering under his breatha scrape at the door caught his attention a heavy sigh of relief escaped him rallick you old bastard he said as he opened the doorfor an instant he thought the hallway empty then his gaze fell to the floor the assassin lay there his clothing soaked through with blood looking up at him with a weak grinsorry im late he said my legs keep giving outcursing murillio helped rallick into the room and on to the bed he returned to the door checked the hallway then shut and set the lockrallick pushed himself upright against the headboard orr offered a contract on colli know i know murillio said as he approached he knelt beside the bed lets see to your woundi need to take off my armour first rallick said ocelot stuck me one then i killed him colls still alive as far as i know what day is thisthe same day murillio said as he helped his friend remove his mail hauberk were still on schedule though from all this blood it looks like you wont be duelling orr at sinitals fte ill handle thatstupid idea rallick groaned youll just get killed and turban orr will walk away still lady sinitals backer and still powerful enough to prevent colls claim to rightsmurillio made no reply to that he peeled back the leather padding to expose the wound whats with all this blood on you he demandedtheres nothing here but a weekold scarhuh rallick probed the place where ocelots wristblade had stabbed him it felt mildly tender itchy at the edges ill be damned he muttered anyway get me a washcloth so i can clean all this rust offmurillio sat back on his haunches clearly confused what rustthe stuff on my face rallick said scowling at his friendmurillio leaned closebaruks magicdeadening powder the assassin snapped how the hell do you think i managed to kill ocelotyour face is clean rallick murillio said youre welcome to the washcloth well get all that dried blood off you in any casegive me a mirror first rallick saidmurillio found one and stood watching rallick study his own pallid reflection which bore a deep frown he observed drily well that expression confirms it for meconfirms what the assassin asked in a dangerous tonethat youre you rallick murillio squared his shoulders rest here for a while youve lost a lot of blood im off to find the eel and tell him a thing or twoyou know who the eel ishe strode to the door ive got a hunch if you can walk try locking this door behind me will youkruppe mopped his brow with his limp sodden handkerchief kruppe has uttered every single detail at least a thousand times master baruk he complained will this ordeal never end look at yon window a whole day in kruppes life has passedthe alchemist sat frowning down at his slippers occasionally wiggling his toes as the minutes passed it was as if hed forgotten kruppes presence in the room and it had been this way for the past hour no matter how much kruppe talkedmaster baruk kruppe tried again may your loyal servant leave hes not yet recovered from his horrific journey in the eastern wastelands simple fare of roast mutton potatoes fried onions and carrots mussels in garlic butter dates cheese smoked slipper minnows and a carafe of wine now occupies kruppes mind to the exclusion of all else such as he has been reduced his world contracting apace with his stomachbaruk spoke for the past year he said slowly an agent of the eels known to me as circle breaker has been providing me with vital information regarding the city councilkruppes mouth shut with an audible clickit lies within my powers of course to identify this circle breaker at my leisure i have a score of missives written in his own handthe parchment alone suffices baruks eyes lifted to fix on the mantelpiece i am considering doing so he said i must speak with this eel weve reached a critical juncture in the life of darujhistan and i must know the eels purposes we could work in close alliance sharing all we know and perhaps we can save the life of this city perhapskruppe cleared his throat and wiped his brow again he carefully folded the handkerchief on his lap then stuffed it into a sleeve if you wish to convey such a message he said quietly kruppe can oblige master barukbaruks gaze dropped calmly to kruppe thank you how soon the replyby this evening kruppe saidexcellent i admit to resisting my own decision to compromise this circle breaker the means you offer seem the best you may go now kruppekruppes head bobbed he rose until tonight then master barukcoll slept while the men in the room continued their discussion mallet said that the man might well sleep for days hoods gate having been close as it wasparan felt frustrated something was missing from whiskeyjacks explanations the saboteurs had gone ahead with planting the mines and even now it was whiskeyjacks plan to detonate them more the efforts to contact the assassins guild remained with the purpose of offering a contract on darujhistans true rulers these facts hardly complemented this idea of a fullscale continentwide revolt if anything wouldnt dujek be seeking local alliancesas the sergeant went on more and more of what the man said gathered in the captains mind and he sensed a pattern emerging he broke his hourlong silence and addressed whiskeyjack you still intend to cripple darujhistan and i keep thinking about that and now i think ive worked out why he studied whiskeyjacks blank expression what you seek is to crack this city wide open chaos in the streets a headless government everybody who matters shows up and they kill each otherwhat does that leave paran leaned forward his eyes hard dujeks got an army ten thousand strong about to become outlaws of the empire maintaining ten thousand soldiers is an expensive business housing them is even tougher dujek knows pales days are numbered caladan broods on the march down the rhivi plain right now are the moranth about to pull out of the alliance maybe make a move of their owntayschrenns in palemaybe old onearm can handle him maybe nothow am i so far sergeantwhiskeyjack glanced over at kalam then shrugged go on he said to parandarujhistans filled with panic no one knows anything in marches dujek rebel army at his heels hell set things aright wealth beyond measure falls into his lapand hell need all of it if hes to oppose what the empress sends after him so the city gets conquered after all fancy that he sat backnot bad whiskeyjack admitted grinning at the surprise on the faces of mallet and kalam with one piece missing something he eyed paran that might relieve the captains sense of betrayal if not his outrageparans smile was cold surprise meall right captain we dont give a damn if the empress wants to come after us she wont have much to do it with since seven cities is days away from reclaiming its independence its coming down captain on all sides so why do we maintain our army look to the south somethings growing there so ugly it makes the imass look like kittenswhen i say were in trouble i dont mean just genabackis i mean the world were all in for a fight captain and thats why we need darujhistanthe south paran asked scepticallynntxta his words a breath of fear the pannion seer so theqore the rumours are true then the seers proclaimed a holy war the genocides purpose of begunrdly cornwhiskeyjack got to his feet explain it to the man he said to kalamthat guild still needs contacting if possible hood knows weve made a show of ourselves at this bar might be whats needed though he looked to paran captain i dont think adjunct lorn should know youre alive do younocan you stay here until i call for youparan glanced at kalam then noddedgood mallet lets moveweve lost at least two days lorn pronounced thankful for the days lingering heat these are thirsty horsestool stood near the shattered barrow marker watching the adjunct ready her horses for the journey into darujhistan how fares your wound adjunct he askedmostly healed she replied otataral has that effect on memy task is finished the imass said if it becomes your desire to accompany me after you have completed your mission i will be found here for the next ten days i wish to observe this jaghut tyrantthough it will not see me nor will i interfere my thoughts of success are with you adjunctlorn climbed on to her horse and stared down at the imass fare well in your search onos toolanthat name is past i am now toolshe grinned then gathered the reins and kicked her mount forward the packhorse trailing on its lead once the finnest was out of her hands she would focus her talents on discovering this coin bearer until now she had not allowed herself to think about oponn she had had too many other more immediate concerns like sorrya strong sense of regret filled her at the loss of captain paran that man would have made her task much easier possibly even enjoyablethough hed been a dour man getting grimmer by the minute she had to admit that she had been attracted to him there might have been something therewell she sighed as she urged her horse up a hillside dyings never in anybodys planstools estimation gave her two days at the most then the jaghut would be fully awake and free of the barrow the finnest would have to be securely in place long before then she looked forward to her meeting with sorry and instinctively brushed a hand against her swords pommel to kill a servant of shadow perhaps the rope himself the empresss pleasure at that would be immenseshe realized that the doubts that had plagued her borne on those wings of knowledge now lay quiescent an effect of her time in the barrow more likely this acorn in her pocket or perhaps shed moved unconsciously beyond them when the time for action comes all doubts must be discarded an old claw tenet she knew herself well and she knew how to control all that was within her years of training discipline loyalty and duty the virtues of a soldiershe was ready for the mission and with this realization the weight on her shoulders vanished she urged her mount into a gallopcrokus craned his head and squinted into the darkness above right to the top he said we can see the whole city from thereapsalar eyed the stairs dubiously its awfully dark she said are you sure this tower is abandoned i mean my father told me stories about ghosts undead monsters and they always lived in ruined places she looked around with wide eyes places just like this onecrokus groaned the god kruls been dead for thousands of years he said besides no one ever comes here so what would all those monsters do with all that spare time what would they eat tell me that stupid stories he walked to the foot of the spiral staircase come on the views worth itshe watched crokus climb upward and hurried to follow before he disappeared from sight what at first seemed to be impenetrable darkness slowly faded to grey and apsalar was surprised to find herself able to discern even the minutest details the first things she noticed were the sootstained paintings on the wall to their left each stone panel was as wide as a single step rising half a dozen feet in a jagged procession that mimicked the stairs crokus she whispered theres a story painted on this wallcrokus snorted dont be ridiculous you cant even see your hand in front of your face in herei canthe continued wait till you get up top those clouds we saw should have cleared the moon by nowtheres something wet on these steps apsalar saidrun off from up top he explained exasperatedno it isnt she insisted its thick and stickycrokus stopped above her look will you be quiet for a minute were almost therethey emerged on to a platform bathed in the moons silver glow near one of the low walls crokus saw a heap of cloth whats that he wondered looks like somebodys been camping up hereapsalar stifled a gasp thats a dead manwhat crokus hissed not another one he rushed to the huddled figure and crouched beside it blessed mowri somebodys stabbed him in the headtheres a crossbow over herehe grunted an assassin i saw one just like this killed here last week theres an assassin war going on just like i told kruppe and murilliolook at the moon apsalar breathed from the far side of the platformcrokus shivered she was still a cold one at times which one he asked risingthe shining one of coursefeeling contrary crokus studied moons spawn instead a fair reddish glow suffused itsomething hed not seen before a worm of fear squirmed in his stomach then his eyes widened five massive winged shapes seemed to sweep down the moons face angling north east he blinked and they were gonedo you see its oceans apsalar askedwhat he turnedits oceans grallins sea thats the big one the lord of the dead waters living there is named grallin he tends vast beautiful underwater gardens grallin will come down to us one day to our world and hell gather his chosen and take them to his world and well live in the gardens warmed by the deep fires and our children will swim like dolphins and well be happy since there wont be any more wars and empires and no swords and shields oh crokus itll be wonderful wont ither profile was in silhouette he stared at her of course he said quietly why not and then that question repeated itself in his head an entirely different reason why notbook seven the ftethe flaying of fander shewolf of winter marks the dawn of gedderone the priestesses race down the streets strips of

into this world a birthing of dragons and this flowing river of fate brought light into dark and dark into light unveiling at last in cold cold eyes the children of chaosmathas children heboricmurillio wondered again at rallicks healed wound hed already concluded that whatever magicdeadening powder of baruks the assassin had used had been responsible for the healing nevertheless much blood had been lost and rallick would need time to recovertime they didnt have was the assassin capable of killing orr nowin answer to his own question murillio laid a hand on the rapier at his side he strode down the empty street cleaving the lowlying mists that swirled like incandescent cloaks in the gaslight dawn was still two hours away as was the daru custom the new years celebrations would begin with sunrise lasting through the day and well into the nighthe walked through a silent city as if he were the last of the living yet to flee the past years turmoil and now shared the world with ghosts tolled among the years dead the five tusks had slipped behind in the ancient cycle and taking its place was the year of the moons tearsmurillio mused on such obscure arcane titles a massive stone disc in majesty hall marked the cycle of the age naming each year in accordance with its mysterious moving mechanismsas a child hed thought the wheel magical in how it spun slowly as the year rolled by coming into the new year aligned precisely with the dawn whether there was cloud in the sky or not mammot had since explained to him that the wheel was in fact a machine it had been a gift to darujhistan over a thousand years ago by a man named icarium it was mammots belief that icarium had jaghut blood by all accounts hed ridden a jaghut horse and a trell strode at his sideclear evidence mammot asserted to add to the wonder of the wheel itself for the jaghut were known to have been skilled at such creationsmurillio wondered at the significance of the names each year borethe close association of the five tusks with moons tears held prophecy according to the seers the boar tennerocks tusks were named hate love laughter war and tears which tusk would prove dominant in the year the new years name provided the answer murillio shruggedhe viewed such astrology with a sceptical eye how could a man of a thousand years agojaghut or otherwisehave predicted such thingsstill he admitted to more than a few qualms the arrival of moons spawn threw the new years title into a different light and he knew that the local scholarsparticularly those who moved in the noble circleshad become an agitated and shorttempered lot quite unlike their usual patronizing selvesmurillio turned a corner on his approach to the phoenix inn and collided with a short fat man in a red coat both grunted and three large boxes that the man had been carrying fell between them spilling out their contentsaye why murillio such fortune as kruppe is known for thus does your search end here in this dank dark street where even the rats shun the shadow what is something the matter friend murilliohe stared down at the objects on the cobbles at his feet slowly murillio asked what are these for kruppekruppe stepped forward and frowned down at the three expertly carved masks gifts friend murillio of course for you and rallick nom after all he looked up with a beatific smile the lady sinitals fte demands the finest in workmanship the subtlest of design perfectly mated with ironic intent dont you think kruppes taste is sufficiently expensive do you fear embarrassmentyoull not distract me this time murillio growled first of all thereindeed kruppe replied bending down to pick one up he brushed spatters of mud from the painted face this is kruppes own well chosen kruppe pronounces with certain aplombmurillios eyes hardened youre not coming kruppewell of course kruppe will attend do you think lady sinital would ever show herself if her longtime acquaintance kruppe the first was not in attendance why shed wither with shamedammit youve never even met sinitalnot relevant to kruppes argument friend murillio kruppe has been acquainted with sinitals existence for many years such association is made better nay pristine for the fact that she has not met kruppe nor kruppe her and in final argument designed to end all discussion here he pulled from his sleeve a parchment scroll tied in blue silk ribbon kruppes invitation signed by the lady herself murillio made a grab for it but kruppe replaced it deftly in his sleeverallick will kill you murillio said levellynonsense kruppe placed the mask over his face how will the lad ever recognize kruppemurillio studied the mans round body the faded red waistcoat gathered cuffs and the short oily curls atop his head never mind he sighedexcellent kruppe said now please accept these two masks gifts from your friend kruppe a trip is saved and baruk need not wait any longer for a secret message that must not be mentioned he replaced his mask in its box then spun round to study the eastern skyline off to yon alchemists abode then good evening friendwait a minute murillio said grasping kruppes arm and turning him round have you seen collwhy of course the man sleeps a deep recovering sleep from his ordeals twas healed magically sulty said by some stranger yet coll himself was brought in by yet a second stranger who found a third stranger who in turn brought a fifth stranger in the company of the stranger who healed coll and so it goes friend murillio strange doings indeed now kruppe must be off goodbye friendnot yet murillio snarled he glanced around the street was still empty he leaned close ive worked some things out kruppe circle breaker contacting me put everything into order in my mind i know who you areaaahh kruppe cried withdrawing ill not deny it then its true murillio kruppe is lady sinital connivingly disguisednot this time no distractions youre the eel kruppe all this blubbering sweaty meekmouse stuff is just an act isnt it youve got half this city in your pocket eeleyes wide kruppe snatched the handkerchief from his sleeve and mopped his brow he wrung sweat from it droplets spattering on the cobbles then a veritable torrent splashed on to the stonesmurillio barked a laugh no more magical cantrips kruppe ive known you a long time remember ive seen you cast spells youve got everybody fooled but not me im not telling though you dont have to worry about that he smiled then again if you dont come out with it here and now i might get annoyedsighing kruppe returned the handkerchief to his sleeve annoyance is uncalled for he said waving a hand and fluttering his fingersmurillio blinked suddenly dizzy he rubbed his forehead and frowned what had they just been talking about it couldnt have been important thanks for the masks friend theyll come in handy im sure his frown deepened what a confusing thing to say he wasnt even angry that kruppe had figured things out nor that the fat little man would attend the fte how odd good that colls all right isnt it well he mumbled id better head back to check on rallicksmiling kruppe nodded until the fte then fare you well murillio kruppes finest and dearest friendgoodnight murillio replied turning to retrace his steps he lacked sleep all these late nights were taking their toll that was the problemof course he muttered then began to walkhis features darkening baruk studied the tiste and lounging in the chair across from him i dont think its a very good idea rakethe lord raised an eyebrow as i understand such things the event includes the wearing of disguises he said with a slight smile do you fear i lack tasteive no doubt your attire will be suitable baruk snapped particularly if you choose the costume of a tiste and warlord its the council that worries me theyre not all foolsi would be surprised if they were rake said indeed i would have you point out the cunning ones i dont imagine you will refute my suspicion that there are those within the council seeking to pave the way for the empressfor a price of course power comes to mind nobles delving in merchant trades no doubt drool at the prospect of empire trade am i far off the mark barukno the alchemist admitted sourly but we have that under controlah yes rake said this brings to mind my other reason for wishing to attend this lady sinitals fte as you said the citys power will be there i assume this includes such mages as are in your torrud cabalsome will attend baruk conceded but i must tell you anomander rake your dbicles with the assassins guild has made a good number of them rue our alliance theyll not appreciate your presence in the leastrakes smile returned to the extent that they will reveal their community to cunning council members i think not he rose in a fluid motion no i would like to attend this fte my own people hold little to such social affairs there are times when i grow weary of their dour preoccupationsbaruks gaze focused on the tiste and you suspect a convergence dont you a fell gathering of powers like iron filings to a lodestonewith so much power gathered in one place rake admitted its likely id rather be on hand in such circumstances his eyes held baruks their colour flowing from dun green to amber also if this event is as publicly known as you suggest then the empires agents within the city will know of it should they wish to cut out darujhistans heart theyll have no better opportunitybaruk barely repressed a shiver extra guards have been hired of course if an empire claw should strike they will find their hands full with the torrud mages besides he thought for a time then nodded wearily very well rake sinital will accept you as my guest you will wear an effective disguisenaturallybaruk climbed to his feet and strode to the window beyond the sky had begun to pale and so it begins he whisperedrake joined him what beginsthe new year the alchemist replied past is the five tusks the dawn you see marks the birth of the year of the moons tearslord anomander rake stiffenedbaruk noticed indeed an unusual coincidence though i would put little weight upon it the titles were devised over a millennium ago by a visitor to these landswhen rake spoke his voice was a ravaged whisper icariums gifts i recognize the style five tusks moons tearsthe wheel is his correcteyes wide baruk hissed his surprise between his teeth a dozen questions struggled to be uttered first but the lord continued in the future id suggest you heed icariums giftsall of them a thousand years is not so long a time alchemist not so long a time icarium last visited me eight hundred years ago in the company of the trell mappo and osricor osserc as the local worshippers call him rake smiled bitterly osric and i argued as i recall and it was all brood could do to keep us apart it was an old argumentinto grey he fell silent lost in memoriesthere came a knock at the door and both turned to see roald enter and bowmaster baruk mammot has awakened and appears refreshed more his almond eyes shaded your agent kruppe has delivered a verbal message he extends his regret that he cannot deliver it to you in person do you wish to receive it nowyes baruk saidroald bowed again the eel will contact you the eve of this day at lady sinitals fte the eel further finds the prospect of shared information and cooperation intriguing that is allbaruk brightened excellentshall i bring mammot to you masterif hes ablehe is a moment then roald leftthe alchemist smiled as i said he laughed everyone will be there and in this case everyone is an appropriate term his smile broadened at rakes blank look the eel lord darujhistans masterspy a figure without a facea masked face the tiste and reminded himif my suspicions are correct baruk said the mask wont help the eel one bitthe door opened again and there stood mammot looking fit and full of energy he nodded to baruk withdrawal proved easier than id imagined he said without preamble his bright gaze fixed on anomander rake and he smiled then bowed greetings lord ive looked forward to this meeting ever since baruk brought to us the offer of alliancerake glanced at baruk and raised an eyebrowthe alchemist said mammot numbers among the vorrud cabal he faced the old man again we were deeply worried friend given the elder mageries at play around the barrowi was snared for a time mammot admitted but at the extreme edges of the omtose phellack influence quiescent regard proved the correct course as the one stirring within did not sense mehow much time do we have baruk asked tightlytwo perhaps three days even for a jaghut tyrant it is an effort to make the return journey to life mammots eyes fell upon the mantelpiece ah your carafe of wine awaits as is usual excellent he strode over to the fireplace have you word of my nephew by any chancebaruk frowned no should i have the last time i met the child was what five years agommm mammot said raising his freshly filled goblet and taking a mouthful well crokus has grown somewhat since then i assure you i hope the lads all right he wasbaruk threw up a hand and staggereda step forward what he demanded in sudden fear whats his name crokus crokus the alchemist rapped his forehead oh what a fool ive beenmammots face crinkled into a wise smile oh you mean the matter of the coin bearer do youshock registered in baruks face you knewstanding to one side his charcoalgrey eyes fixed intently on mammot rake said in a strangely flat tone mammot forgive me for interrupting will you be attending lady sinitals ftethe old man nodded easily of coursevery good rake said with something like anticipation he pulled his leather gloves from his belt well speak thenbaruk had no time to think about rakes sudden departure it was his first mistake of the daya woman with a shaved head and long flowing robes ran shrieking from the gates a shred of brown fur streaming from one hand adjunct lorn stepped back to let the priestess pass she watched as the woman plunged into the crowd behind her the festival had spilled out beyond darujhistans walls and worrytowns main street was a streaming mob shed spent the last halfhour pushing through on her way to the gatesabsently she rubbed the rapier wound in her shoulder her journey into the barrow seemed to have slowed the healing and an ache had settled inside the puncture cold as the ice in the barrows tunnel eyeing the two guards stationed at the gate she approached warilyonly one seemed to pay her any attention and this man spared her but the briefest glance before returning his attention to the worrytown moblorn entered the city unremarked simply one more traveller come to attend the spring festivalimmediately within the gates the avenue split around the base of a squat hill on which crouched a halfruined temple and tower off to her right rose another hill evidently a garden given the wide steps ascending to the summit covered in trees and the many fetishes and banners tied to branches and the gaslampslorns sense of those she sought was strong unerring once past the hills she could see an inner wall sergeant whiskeyjack and his squad were somewhere beyond it in the lower city lorn strode through the surging crowds one hand hitched in her sword belt the other massaging the puffed red flesh around her woundthe guard at worry gate pushed himself from the wall he had been leaning against and paced a slow circle on the cobblestones he paused to adjust his peaked helmet loosening the strap a notchthe other guard an older man bandylegged and short approachedthose fools out there making you uneasy he asked with a grin more gaps than teeththe first man glanced through the gateway had a nearriot here a couple of years back he saidi was there the old man said hawking on to the stones we had to pull the hoods off our polearms draw some blood that sent them packing and i dont think the lessons gone on them i wouldnt worry much this aint your regular duty is itno just filling in time for a friendthats the way of it isnt it whats your usual roundmidnight till the third bell despots barbican circle breaker repliedhe adjusted his helmet again hoping the unseen friendly eyes had marked his signal that woman who had passed through a few minutes ago had matched the eels description perfectly circle breaker knew he wasnt mistakenshed looked the warrior dressed as a mercenary and trying to hide the bloodstains of a wound on her shoulder his searching glance had been but momentary years of practice however made it sufficient hed caught everything the eels messenger had told him to look forthats a hell of a watch the old man said beside him turning to squint up at despots park and you were here t meet the dawn he wagged his head the bastards got us working too hard these days what with the city infiltrated with empire spies and the likeit doesnt get any better circle breaker agreedim here for another three hours and you think they give me some time to join my wife and kids in the festival the old man spat againno way old berrutes off to stand around watching other people having fun in some bloody estatecircle breaker held his breath then sighed lady sinitals fte i supposedamn right bloody councilmen chuffing around with all their stinking airs and me with sore feet and all standing like a statuethis was a bit of luck circle breaker smiled to himself his companions next station was precisely what the eel had wanted for circle breaker better yet the old man was complaining about it they need those statues he said keeps them secure he stepped close to berrutedidnt you tell the sergeant about your bad feetwhats the point berrute complained he just delivered them orders he didnt come up with theincircle breaker looked up the street as if considering something then he laid a hand on the others shoulder and met his gaze look i dont have any family for me todays just another day ill stand in for you berrute next time i want some time off though ill come callinggenuine relief lit the old mans eyes nerruse bless you he said grinning again its a deal friend hey i dont even know your namecircle breaker smiled then told himwith most of the revelry out in the streets the interior of quips bar was all but deserted adjunct lorn paused inside the doorway and waited for her eyes to adjust to the gloom a few desultory voices drifted out to her mingling with the clatter of wooden cardsshe entered the lowceilinged chamber a dishevelled old woman watched her dully from behind the counter against the far wall was a table at which sat three men copper coins glittered in the lamplight amid pools of spilled beer on the tabletop the men held cards in their handsthe man with his back against the wall wearing a scorched leather cap looked up to meet lorns eyes he gestured to an empty chair have a seat adjunct he said join in the gamelorn blinked then hid her shock with a shrug i dont gamble she said lowering herself into the rickety chairthe man examined his cards not what i meant he saidthe one seated on her left muttered meant a different game did hedgeshe turned to

all this whiskeyjack said tightly it couldve been arranged adjunct but you kept it to yourself and that makes you on your own now his eyes hardened on her whether we contact the guild or not we detonate the mines before tomorrows dawn and then were out of herelorn drew herself up i am adjunct to the empress sergeant as of now this mission is under my direction you will take orders from me all this independent crap is over understand for a moment she almost thought she saw a flash of triumph in the mans eyes a second look revealed it to be no more than the expected angerunderstood adjunct whiskeyjack replied curtly what are your ordersi am serious in this sergeant she warned and i dont care how angry this makes you now i suggest we retire to more private surroundings she rose your men can remain herewhiskeyjack stood of course adjunct we have the back room if you will follow melorn reached down to the beds top blanket there is blood here sergeant she turned to regard the man as he closed the doorhe faced her one of my men had a brush with a tiste and assassinmage hell recoverhighly unlikely sergeant the tiste and are all with caladan brood in the north her eyes widened in disbelief you dont mean to suggest that the lord of moons spawn himself has left his fortress to do what hunt down malazan spies dont be absurdwhiskeyjack scowled corporal kalam and my squad mage had a rooftop engagement with at least half a dozen tiste and that my men survived makes it highly unlikely that the moons lord was anywhere in the vicinity doesnt it adjunct put it together the moon stations itself just south of the city its lord strikes an alliance with darujhistans rulers and their first task is to wipe out the local assassins guild why to prevent people like us from contacting them and offering a contract and so far its workedlorn thought for a time then she said so if the guild cannot be contacted why not do the assassinations yourselves your corporal kalam ranked among the best in the claw before his his falling out why not take out the citys rulersthe man folded his arms across his chest and leaned against the wall beside the door weve been considering that adjunct and were a step ahead of you right now one of my men is negotiating for us to work as private strongarms for a highbrow fte this evening everybody whos anybody is supposed to attendcouncil members high mages the works my saboteurs have enough leftover munitions to make it a party this city will have a hard time forgettinglorn struggled against a growing sense of frustration as much as shed intended to take command of things it seemed that this whiskeyjack had been doing just fine up until now given the circumstances she suspected she could not have done things any better though she still doubted the story about the tiste and why on earth she asked finally would an estate hire a bunch of strangers as guardsoh therell be city soldiers there as well but none of them is a barghast whiskeyjack smiled cynically titillation factor adjunct its what makes the nobility drool look there a big tattooed barbarian glowering down at them exciting yes he shrugged its a risk but one worth taking unless of course you have a better idea adjunctshe heard the challenge in his tone had she thought about it she would have realized long before now that her title and power would not intimidate this man hed stood at dassem ultors side arguing tactics with the sword of the empire in the midst of battle and it seemed that demotion to sergeant had failed to break this manthat much shed gathered from the bridgeburners reputation at pale he would not hesitate to challenge her every command if he found reason to do soyour plan is sound she said tell me the name of this estatesome woman named lady sinital i dont know the family name but everybody seems to know her said to be a real looker with influence in the councilvery well lorn said adjusting her cloak ill return in two hours sergeant there are other matters i must attend to be certain that all is readydetonation procedures included if you dont get hired well have to find another way of being at that fte she strode to the dooradjunctshe turnedwhiskeyjack walked to the back wall and pulled aside a tattered hanging this tunnel emerges into another house from it you can enter the daru districtunnecessary lorn was irritated by his condescending toneas soon as she was gone quick ben scrambled from the tunneldammit sergeant he muttered you almost had her walking in on meno chance whiskeyjack observed in fact i made certain she wouldnt use it anything from kalamquick ben paced the small room not yet but hes about to run out of patience he turned to the sergeant so do you think she was fooledfooled whiskeyjack laughed she was reelingparan said she was going to drop something off quick ben saiddid shenot yetits getting tight sergeant damn tightthe other door opened and trotts entered his filed teeth exposed in something between a smile and a grimacesuccess whiskeyjack askedtrotts noddedas the afternoon waned crokus and apsalar waited atop the towers platform every now and then they peered over the edge to watch the festivities there was a taste of mania among the crowds below as if they danced on the rim of desperation in spite of the seasons rejoicing the shadow of the malazan empire hung over all indeed with moons spawn immediately to the south darujhistans place between the two forces was obvious to everyonesomehow crokus muttered as he watched the crowds moving down the streets like churning rivers darujhistan seems smaller almost insignificantit looks huge to me apsalar said its one of the biggest cities ive ever seen she said as big as unta i thinkhe stared at her shed been saying strange things lately which did not seem right coming from a fishergirl from a small coastal villagethats the empire capital isnt itshe frowned which made her look older yes only ive never been therewell how could you know how big it is thenim not sure crokuspossession coll had said two sets of memory warred in the woman and the war was getting worse he wondered if mammot had shown up yet for a moment he came near to regretting their escape from meese and irilta but then his thoughts turned to what was to come he sat down on the platform and propped himself against the low wall he stared at the assassins body across from him the blood that had been spilled had blackened under the hot sun a trail of droplets crossed the floor to the stairs clearly this assassins killer had himself been wounded yet crokus did not feel in danger up here although he wasnt sure why for an abandoned belfry tower this place had witnessed a lot of drama latelyare we waiting for night apsalar askedcrokus noddedthen we find this challicethats right the darles will be at lady sinitals fte im sure of it the estate has an enormous garden almost a forest it goes right up to the back wall getting in should be easywont you be noticed once you join the guests thoughill be dressed as a thief everybody will be wearing costumes besides therell be hundreds of people there it might take an hour or two but ill find herand thenill think of something crokus saidapsalar stretched out her legs on the paving stones and crossed her arms and im supposed to hide in the bushes huhhe shrugged maybe uncle mammot will be there he said then everything will be all rightwhybecause thats what coll said crokus shot back exasperatedsupposed to tell her shed been possessed for who knew how long we work out a way to get you home he explained thats what you want rightshe nodded slowly as if no longer certain of that i miss my father she saidto crokus apsalar sounded as though she was trying to convince herself hed looked at her when theyd arrived thinking why not and he had to admit to himself now that her company wasnt bad except for all the questions of course mind what if hed been in her situation waking up thousands of leagues from home itd be terrifying would he have held up as well as she seemed to be doingim feeling all right she said watching him its as if something inside is keeping things together i cant explain it any better but its like a smooth black stone solid and warm and whenever i start getting scared it takes me inside and then everythings fine again she added im sorry i didnt mean to push you awaynever mind he saidwithin the shadows of the stairwell serrat studied the two figures out on the platform enough was enough shed opened her kurald galain warren into a defensive layering of wards around her no more of these invisible enemies if they wanted her theyd have to show themselvesand then shed kill them and as for the coin bearer and the girl where could they hope to escape to up here on this towershe unsheathed her daggers and prepared for her attack a dozen wards protected her back all along the staircase an approach from there was impossibletwo sharp points touched her flesh one under her chin and the other beneath her left shoulder blade the tiste and froze and then she heard a voice close to her eara voice she recognizedgive rake this warning serrat hell only get one and the same for you the coin bearer shall not be harmed the games are done try this again and youll dieyou bastard she exploded my lords angerwill be in vain we both know who sends this message dont we and as rake well knows hes not as far away as he once was the point beneath her chin moved away to allow her to nod then returned good deliver the message then and hope we dont meet againthis will not be forgotten serrat promised shaking with ragea low chuckle answered her compliments of the prince serrat take it up with our mutual friendthe daggers left her flesh serrat exhaled a long breath then sheathed her weapons she snapped a kurald galain spell and vanishedcrokus jumped at a faint plopping sound from the stairwell he laid his hands on his knives tensingwhats wrong apsalar saidshhh wait he felt his heart pound hard against his chest im ducking at shadows he said sitting back well were off soon anywayit was an age of wind sweeping across the grass plains beneath a pewter sky a wind whose thirst assailed all life mindless unrelenting like a beast that did not know itselfstruggling in his mothers wake it was raests first lesson in power in the hunt for domination that would shape his life he saw the many ways of the windits subtle sculpting of stone over hundreds and then thousands of years and its raging gales that flattened forestsand found closest to his heart the violent power of the winds banshee furyraests mother had been the first to flee his deliberate shaping of power shed denied him to his face proclaiming the sundering of blood and thus cutting him free that the ritual had broken her he disregardedit was unimportant he who would dominate must learn early that those resisting his command should be destroyed failure was her price not hiswhile the jaghut feared community pronouncing society to be the birthplace of tyrannyof the flesh and the spiritand citing their own bloody history as proof raest discovered a hunger for it the power he commanded insisted upon subjects strength was ever relative and he could not dominate without the company of the dominatedat first he sought to subjugate other jaghut but more often than not they either escaped him or he was forced to kill them such contests held only momentary satisfaction raest gathered beasts around him bending nature to his will but nature withered and died in bondage and so found an escape he could not control in his anger he laid waste to the land driving into extinction countless species the earth resisted him and its power was immense yet it was directionless and could not overwhelm raest in its ageless tide his was a focused power precise in its destruction and pervasive in its effectthen into his path came the first of the imass creatures who struggled against his will defying slavery and yet living on creatures of boundless pitiful hope for raest he had found in them the glory of domination for with each imass that broke he took another their link with nature was minimal for the imass themselves played the game of tyranny over their lands they could not defeat himhe fashioned an empire of sorts bereft of cities yet plagued with the endless dramas of society its pathetic victories and inevitable failure the community of enslaved imass thrived in this quagmire of pettines they even managed to convince themselves that they possessed freedom a will of their own that could shape destiny they elected champion they tore down their champions once failure draped its shroud over them they ran in endless circles and called it growth emergence knowledge while over them all a presence invisible to their eyes raest flexed his will his greatest joy came when his slaves proclaimed him godthough they knew him notand constructed temples to serve him and organized priesthoods whose activities mimicked raests tyranny with such cosmic irony that the jaghut could only shake his headit should have been an empire to last for millennia and its day of dying should have been by his own hand when he at last tired of itraest had never imagined that other jaghut would find his activities abhorrent that they would risk themselves and their own power on behalf of these shortlived smallminded imass yet what astonished raest more than anything else was that when the jaghut came they came in numbers in community a community whose sole purpose of existence was to destroy his empire to imprison himhe had been unpreparedthe lesson was learned and no matter what the world had become since that time raest was ready for it his limbs creaked at first throbbing with dull aches bridged by sharp pangs the effort of digging himself from the frozen earth had incapacitated him for a time but finally he felt ready to walk the tunnel that opened out into a new landpreparation already hed initiated his first moves he sensed that others had come to him had freed the path of omtose phellack wards and sealsperhaps his worshippers remained fanatics who had sought his release for generations and even now awaited him beyond the barrowthe missing finnest would be his first priority much of his power had been stored within the seed stripped from him and stored there by the jaghut betrayers it had not been carried far and there was nothing that could prevent his recovering it omtose phellack no longer existed in the land abovehe could feel its absence like an airless void nothing could oppose him nowpreparation raests withered cracked face twisted into a savage grin his lower tusks splitting desiccated skin the powerful must gather other power subjugate it to their own will then direct it unerringly his moves had already begunhe sloshed through the slush now covering the barrows muddy floorbefore him rose the slanted wall that marked the tombs barrier beyond the limestreaked earth waited a world to be enslaved raest gestured and the barrier exploded outward bright sunlight flared in the clouds of steam rolling around him and he felt waves of cold ancient air sweeping past himthe jaghut tyrant walked into the lightthe great raven crone rode the hot streams of wind high above the gadrobi hills the burst of power that launched tons of earth and rocks a hundred feet into the sky elicited a cackle from her she dipped a wing eyes on the white pillar of steam and banked towards itthis she laughed to herself should prove interestinga wash of air pounded down on to her shrieking her outrage crone twisted and slid along the shunting wind massive shadows flowed over her her anger was swept away on a surge of excitement head craning she beat the air with her wings and climbed again in matters such as these a proper point of view was essential crone climbed higher still then cocked her head and looked down by the light of the sun scales flashed iridescent from five ridged backs but of the five one shone like fire sorcerous power bled in ripples from the web of their spread wingsthe dragons sailed silent over the landscape closing on the billowing dustcloud above the jaghut tomb crones black eyes fixed on the dragon that blazed redsilanah she screamed laughing dragnipurake tna draconiaes eleint eleint the day of the tiste and had comeraest emerged into rich afternoon sunlight yellowgrassed hills rose in weathered humps in every direction but the one he faced to the east behind a thinning curtain of drifting dust stretched an empty plainthe jaghut tyrant grunted not so different after all he raised his arms feeling wind slide along his cabled muscles he drew a breath tasting the liferich air he quested lightly with his power and exulted in the waves of fear that answered itanswers that came from the mindless life beneath his feet or hiding in the grasses around him but higher life higher concentrations of power he sensed nothing he drove his senses down into the ground seeking what dwelt there earth and bedrock the sluggish molten darkness beneath down down to fi the sleeping goddessyoung as far as the jaghut tyrant was concerned shall i wake you he whispered not yet but i shall make you bleed his right hand closed into a fisthe speared the goddess with pain driving a fissure through the bedrock feeling the gush of her blood enough to make her stir but not awakenthe line of hills to the north lifted skyward magma sprayed into the air amid a rising pillar of smoke rock and ash the earth shuddered even as the sound of the eruption swept over raest in a fierce hot wind the jaghut tyrant smiledhe studied the shattered ridge and breathed the heavy sulphurous air then turned about and strode west towards the highest hill in that his the not s air that direction his finnest lay beyond it perhaps three days walk he considered opening his warren then decided to wait until he reached the hills summit from that vantage point he could better judge the finnests locationhalfway up the slope he heard distant laughter raest stiffened just as the day darkened suddenly around him on the sward before him he saw five enormous shadows sweeping up the slope then beyond the hills summit the sunlight returned the jaghut tyrant looked into the sky above himfive dragons banked in perfect formation their heads dipping to watch him as they glided back in his direction estideein eleint he whispered in his jaghut tongue four were black barbed in silver along the wings and flying two to either side of the fifth dragon this one red and twice at large as the others silanah redwings raest muttered eyes vamptvswin elderborn and trueblooded tiarn you lead soletakenkintblood is alien to this world i feel you all he raised fists to the sky colder than the ice born of jaghut hands as dark as blindnessi feel youhe lowered his arms harass me not eleint i cannot enslave you but i will destroy you know that i will drive you to the ground each and all and with my own hands i shall tear your hearts from your chestshis eyes narrowed on the four black dragons soletaken you would challenge me at the command of another you would battle with me for no reason of your own ah but if i were to command you i would not throw your lives away so carelessly i would cherish you soletaken i would give you causes worth believing in show you the true rewards of power raest scowled as their derision swept through his mind so be it the dragons passed low overhead in silence banking once again and disappearing behind the hills to the south raest spread his arms wide and unleashed his warren his flesh split as power flowed into him his arms shed skin like ash he both felt and heard hills crack all around him the snapping of stone the sundering of crags to all sides the horizons blurred as dust curtained skyward he faced south this is my power come to me a long minute passed he frowned at the hills before him then cried out and whirled to his right just as silanah and the four black dragons all less than ten feet above the ground plunged over the summit of the hill hed been climbingraest screamed at the whirlwind of power battering him his shrunken eyes locked on silanahs blank empty deadly gazeeyes as large as the jaghuts headas it bore down upon him with the speed of a springing viper the red dragons jaws opened wide and raest found himself staring down the beasts throathe screamed a second time and released his power all at oncethe air detonated as the warrens collided jagged shards of rock ripped in all directions starvald demelain and kurald galain warred with omtose phellack in a savage maelstrom of will grasses earth and rock withered to fine ash on all sides and within the vortex stood raest his power roaring from him lashes of sorcery from the dragons lanced into his body boring through his withered fleshthe jaghut tyrant flayed his power like a scythe blood spattered the ground sprayed in gouts the dragons shriekeda wave of incandescent fire struck raest from the right solid as a battering fist howling he was thrown through the air landing in a bank of powdery ash silanahs fire raced over him blackening what was left of his flesh the tyrant clambered upright his body jerking uncontrollably as sorcery gouted from his right handthe ground shook as raests power hammered silanah down driving the dragon skidding and tumbling across the slope the tyrants exultant roar was cut short as talons the length of a forearm crunched into him from behind a second clawed foot joined the first snapping through the bones of raests chest as if they were twigs more talons flexed around him as a second dragon sought gripthe tyrant twisted helplessly as the claws lifted him into the air and started ripping his body apart he dislocated his own shoulder in reaching round to dig his fingers into a sleek scaled shin at the contact omtose phellack surged into the dragons leg shattering bone boiling blood raest laughed as the claws spasmed loose and he was flung awaymore bones snapped as he struck the ground but it did not matter his power was absolute the vessel that carried it had little relevance if need be the tyrant would find other bodies bodies in the thousandshe climbed once more to his feet now he whispered i deliver deathchapter twentyonethe flowering of light from darkness brought into my sight there on the field a host of dragons caught like a crest of wind before the eternal flamei saw the ages in their eyes a worldly map inscribed in each whirled scale on their hidestheir sorcery bled from them like the breathing of stars and i knew then that dragons had come among usanomandaris fisher bshadows crowded the gardens undergrowth adjunct lorn rose from her crouch and brushed the dirt from her hands find an acorn she smiled to herself plant itsomewhere beyond the heavily wooded garden servants shouted at each other as they scrambled about making lastminute arrangementsshe hitched her cloaks tail into her belt and quietly slipped among the boles of vinewrapped trees a moment later the back wall came into viewan alley lay beyond narrow and choked with the leaves and fallen branches from the gardens rising above the walls on its either side her route inand now outwas a thing of ease she scaled the roughstoned wall grasping vines when necessary then slid over the topshe landed with a soft crunch of twigs and dry leaves within shadows as deep as those in the garden she adjusted her cloak then walked to one end of the alley where she leaned against a corner crossed her arms and smiled at the crowds passing to and fro on the street before hertwo tasks left to perform then she would leave this city one of those tasks however might prove impossible she sensed nothing of sorrys presence perhaps the woman was indeed dead under the circumstances it was the only explanationshe watched the sea of people its tide of faces swirling past the latent madness there made her uneasy especially with the citys guards maintaining an aloof distance she wondered at the taint of terror in that multitude of faces and how almost every face seemed familiardarujhistan blurred in her mind becoming a hundred other cities each rising out of her past as if on parade joy and fear agony and laughterthe expressions merged into one the sounds coming to her no different from each other she could distinguish nothing the faces becoming expressionless the sounds a roar of history without meaninglorn passed a hand over her eyes then staggered back a step and reeled into the alleys shadows behind her she slid down one wall into a sagging crouch a celebration of insignificance is that all we are in the end listen to them in a few hours the citys intersections would explode hundreds would die instantly thousands to follow amid the rubble of shattered cobbles and toppled buildings would be these faces locked in expressions somewhere between joy and terror and from the dying would come sounds hopeless cries that dwindled in the passing of painshed seen them all before those faces she knew them all knew the sound of their voices sounds mired in human emotions sounds clear and pure with thought and sounds wavering in that chasm between the twois this she wondered my legacy and one day ill be just one more of those faces frozen in death and wonderlorn shook her head but it was a wan effort she realized with sudden comprehension that she was breaking down the adjunct was cracking its armour crumbling and the lustre gone from its marbled grandeur a title as meaningless as the woman bearing it the empressjust another face shed seen somewhere before a mask behind which someone hid from mortalityno use hiding she whispered frowning down at the dead leaves and branches around her no use a few minutes later she pushed herself upright once again she brushed the dirt meticulously from her cloak one task remained within her abilities find the coin bearer kill him and take oponns coinmake the god pay for its intrusion in empire affairsthe empress and tayschrenn would see to thatthe task demanded concentration fixing her senses upon one particular signature it would be her last act she knew but she would succeeddeath at the hands of failure was unthinkable lorn turned to the streetdusk crept from the ground and engulfed the crowds far off to the east thunder sounded yet the air was dry with no hint of rain she checked her weapons the adjuncts mission she said quietly is almost doneshe entered the street and disappeared into the mobkruppe rose from his table at the phoenix inn and attempted to fasten the last button on his waistcoat failing he let his stomach relax once again and let loose a weary sigh well at least the coat had been cleanedhe adjusted the cuffs of his new shirt then walked out of the mostly empty barhed spent the last hour seated at his table to all outward appearances musing on nothing of great importance though in his head a pattern formed born of his talent and it disturbed him greatly meese and irilta losing crokus and the girl brought everything into focusas with most unwitting servants of the gods once the game was done so was the servants life the coin might be gambled in a single contest but to have it floating around indefinitely was far too dangerous no crokus would find his luck abandoning him when he needed it most and it would cost the lad his lifeno no kruppe had murmured over his tankard kruppe cant permit that yet the pattern of success remained elusive he felt certain he had covered all the potential threats regarding the lad or rather someone was doing a good job of protecting crokusthat much the pattern showedhim he experienced a nagging suspicion that the someone wasnt himself or any of his agents and hed just have to trust in its integritycircle breaker had come through yet again and kruppe was still confident that turban orrs hunt for the man would prove fruitless the eel knew how to protect his own in fact circle breaker was due for retirementfor the mans own safetyand kruppe intended to deliver the good news this very night at lady sinitals fte circle breaker deserved no less after all these yearsthe pattern also told him something he already knew his cover was blown the spell he had cast on murillio wouldnt last much longer nor was it required to kruppe had wanted his freedom unimpeded this dayafter that well things would fall as they would falland the same applied for his meeting with barukif anything gave kruppe pause it was the patterns abrupt endingbeyond tonight the future was blank clearly a crux had been reached and it would turn he knew at lady sinitals ftekruppe now entered the higher estates district with a generous nod at the lone guard stationed near the ramp the man scowled but otherwise made no comment the fte was set to begin in thirty minutes and kruppe planned on being one of the first to arrive his mouth watered at the thought of all those pastries fresh and dripping with warm sweet liquids he removed his mask from inside his coat and smiled at itperhaps among all those attending high alchemist baruk alone would appreciate the irony of this moulded visage ah well he sighed one is more than enough given who that one is after all is kruppe greedyhis stomach rumbled in answercrokus strained his eyes towards the darkening east something like lightning flashed every now and then beyond the hills each one closer than the last but the thunders rumble which had begun early that afternoon and still continued sounded somehow wrong its timbre unlike the normal bass that rolled through the earth it seemed almost brittle the clouds that had appeared over the hill earlier had been an eerie ochre colour sickly and those clouds now approached the citywhen are we leaving apsalar asked leaning on the wall beside himcrokus shook himself now its dark enoughcrokus what will you do if challice darle betrays you a second timehe could barely see her face in the gloom had she meant that to cutit was hard to tell from her voice she wont he said telling himself that he believed it trust me and he turned towards the stairwelli do she said simplycrokus winced why did she make things seem so easy for herhoods breath he wouldnt trust him of course he didnt know challice very well theyd only had that one confusing conversationwhat if she called the guards well hed make sure apsalar got away safely he paused and grasped her arm listen his own voice sounded unduly harsh but he pushed on if something goes wrong go to the phoenix inn right find meese irilta or my friends kruppe and murillio tell them what happenedall right crokusgood he released her arm wish we had a lantern he said as he stepped into the darkness one hand reaching before himwhy apsalar asked slipping past him she took his hand and led him down i can see dont let go of my handthat might be a hard thing to do even if hed desired it he realizedstill there were a lot of rough calluses on that small hand he let them remind him of what this woman was capable of doing though the effort embarrassed him in some vague wayeyeswide yet seeing nothing crokus allowed himself to be guidedcaptain of sinitals house guard viewed whiskeyjack and his men with obvious distaste i thought you were all barghast he stepped up to trotts and jabbed a finger into the warriors massive chest you led me to believe you were all like you nigangaa low menacing growl emerged from trotts and the captain stepped back one hand reaching for his short swordcaptain whiskeyjack said if we were all barghastthe mans narrow face swung to him with a scowlyoud never be able to afford us the sergeant finished with a tight smile he glanced at trotts niganga hoods breath niganga is my secondincommand captain now how would you like

when i say gently i mean it youre to salute anyone who talks to you and if theres an argument direct them to me captain stillis ill be making the rounds but any one of the house guard can find mewhiskeyjack nodded understood sir he turned to survey his squadfiddler and hedge stood behind trotts both looking eager past them mallet and quick ben stood on the edge of the street heads bent together in conversation the sergeant frowned at them noticing how his wizard winced with every boom of thunder to the eastcaptain stillis marched off after giving them directions through the estates rooms out to the terrace and garden beyond whiskeyjack waited for the man to leave his line of sight then he strode to quick ben and mallet whats wrong he askedquick ben looked frightenedmallet said that thunder and lightning sergeant well it aint no storm parans story is looking realmeaning we have little time whiskeyjack said wonder why the adjunct didnt show upyou think shes melting her boots getting away from heremallet shruggeddont you get it quick ben said shakily he took a couple of deep breaths then continued that creature out there is in a fight were talking major sorceries only its getting closer which means that its winning and that meanswere in trouble whiskeyjack finished all right we go as planned for now come on weve been assigned right where we want to be quick ben you sure kalam and paran can find usthe wizard moaned directions delivered sergeantgood lets move then through the house and eyes forwardhe looks like hes going to sleep for days kalam said straightening beside colls bed and facing the captain paran rubbed his redshot eyes she must have given them something he insisted wearily even if they didnt see itkalam wagged his head ive told you sir she didnt everyone was on the lookout for something like that the squads still clean now wed better get movingparan climbed to his feet with an effort he was exhausted and he knew he was just an added burden

floor as they passed along the counter scurve looked at them warilykalam released an exasperated curse and in a surge of motion reached out and grasped him by the shirt he pulled the squealing innkeeper halfway across the counter until their faces were inches apartim sick of waiting the assassin growled you get this message to this citys master of the assassins i dont care how just do it and do it fast heres the message the biggest contract offer of the masters life will be waiting at the back wall of lady sinitals estate tonight if the guild masters worthy of that name then maybejust maybeits not too big for the guild to handle deliver that message even if you have to shout it from the rooftops or im coming back here with killing in mindparan stared at his corporal too tired to be amazed were wasting time he drawledkalam tightened his grip and glared into scurves eyes wed better not be he growled he released the man by gently lowering him on to the countertop then he tossed a handful of silver coins beside scurvefor your troubles he saidparan gestured and the assassin nodded they left the phoenix innstill following orders corporalkalam grunted we were instructed to make the offer in the name of the empress captain if the contracts accepted and the assassinations are done then laseen will have to pay up whether weve been outlawed or nota gutted city for dujek and his army to occupy with the empress paying for it shell choke on that kalamhe grinned thats her problem not minein the street the greyfaces moved through the noisy crowd like silent spectres lighting the gaslamps with longpoled sparkers some people brazen with drink hugged the figures and blessed them the greyfaces hooded and anonymous simply bowed in reply and continued on their way once freedkalam stared at them his brows knittingsomething the matter corporal paran askedjust something nagging me cant pin it down only its got to do with those greyfacesthe captain shrugged they keep the lanterns lit shall we make our way thenkalam sighed might as well sirthe black lacquered carriage drawn by two dun stallions moved slowly through the press a dozen feet ahead marched a brace of baruks own house guards driving a wedge down the streets centre using their wrapped weapons when shouts and curses failedin the plush confines of the carriage the outside roar surged and ebbed like a distant tide muted by the alchemists sounddeadening spells he sat with his chin lowered on his chest his eyeshidden in the shadow of his brow and halfshutstudying the tiste and seated across from him rake had said nothing since his return to the estate just minutes before their planned departurebaruks head throbbed sorcery shook the hills to the east sending waves of concussion that struck every mage

didnt have days they had hoursyet despite the warring warrens despite the fact that the jaghut tyrants power was superior to rakes magesthat the barron dweller came on relentless unstoppable a growing storm of omtose phellack sorcerythe lord of moons spawn sat at ease on the padded couch his legs stretched out before him and gloved hands folded in his lap the mask lying on the velvet at his side was exquisite if ghastly in better times baruk might have been amused appreciative of its workmanship but right now when he regarded it his lone response was suspicion a secret was locked in that mask something that bespoke the man who would wear it but the secret eluded barukturban orr adjusted his hawk mask and paused just before the wide steps leading to the estates main doors he heard another carriage arrive at the gates and turned from the doorway at his back came the shuffle of footstepslady sinital spoke behind him i would rather youd permitted one of my servants to inform me of your arrival councilman allow me the privilege of escorting you into the main chamber she slipped her arm through hisa moment he muttered eyes on the figure now emerging from the carriage its the alchemists carriage he said but thats hardly baruk now is itlady sinital looked trake unleashed she gasped who would that bebaruks guest orr said drilyher grip bit into his arm im aware of his privilege councilman tell me have you seen this one beforethe man shrugged hes masked how could i tellhow many men do you know turban who are seven feet tall and wear twohanded swords strapped to their backs she squinted that white hair do you think its part of the maskthe councilman did not reply he watched as baruk emerged behind the stranger the alchemists mask was a conservative silverinlaid halfshield that no more than covered his eyes an obvious statement denying duplicity turban orr grunted knowing well that his suspicions about the alchemists influence and power were accurate his eyes returned to the stranger his mask was that of a black dragon lacquered with fine silvertraced highlights somehow the dragons expression seemed slywell lady sinital demanded are we going to linger out here all night and wheres your dear wife anywayill he said distractedly he smiled at her shall we introduce ourselves to the alchemists guest and have i complimented you yet on your attireyou havent she saida black panther suits you ladybut of course it does she replied testily as baruk and his guest str down the paved walk towards them she disengaged her arm and stepped forward good evening alchemist baruk welcome she added to the blackdragonmasked man an astonishing presentation have we metgood evening lady sinital baruk said bowing councilman turban orr permit me to introduce he hesitated but the tiste and had been firm on this lord anomander rake a visitor to darujhistanthe alchemist waited to see if the councilman would recognize the nameturban orr bowed formally on behalf of the city council welcome lord anomander rakebaruk sighed anomander rake a name known by poets and scholars but not it appeared by councilmenorr continued as a lord i assume you hold title to land he almost stepped back as the dragons visage swung to regard him deep blue eyes fixed on hisland yes councilman i hold title however my title is honorary presented to me by my people rake looked past orrs shoulder to the room beyond the wide doorway it seems lady that the evening is well under wayindeed she laughed come join in the festivitiesbaruk breathed another relieved sighmurillio had to admit that kruppes choice of mask suited him perfectlyhe found himself grinning behind his featherdecked peacock mask in spite of his trepidation he stood near the opened doorway leading out to the patio and garden a goblet of light wine in one hand the other hitched in his beltrallick leaned against the wall beside him arms crossed his mask was that of a catlin tiger idealized to mimic the god trakes imagemurillio knew the assassin let the wall bear his weight out of exhaustion rather than from a lazy slouch he wondered yet again if matters would fall to him the assassin stiffened suddenly eyes on the entrance across from themmurillio craned to see past the crowd there the hawk he murmured thats turban orr all right whos he withsinital rallick growled and baruk and some monster of a man wearing a dragons maskand armedbaruk murillio laughed nervously lets hope he doesnt recognize us it wouldnt take him a second to put everything togetherit doesnt matter rallick said he wont stop usmaybe youre right then murillio almost dropped his glass hoods weary feetrallick hissed between his teeth dammit look at him hes heading straight for themlady sinital and turban orr excused themselves leaving baruk and rake momentarily alone in the middle of the chamber people moved around them some nodding deferentially at baruk but all keeping their distance a crowd gathered around sinital where she stood at the foot of the winding staircase eager with questions regarding anomander rakea figure approached baruk and his companion short round wearing a faded red waistcoat both hands clutching pastries the man wore a cherubs mask its open redlipped mouth smeared with cake icing and crumbs his route to them met with one obstacle after another as he negotiated his way across the room excusing himself at every turn and twistrake noticed the newcomer for he said seems eager doesnt hebaruk chuckled hes worked for me he said and ive worked for him as well anomander rake behold the one they call the eel darujhistans masterspydo you jestnokruppe arrived his chest heaving master baruk he said breathlessly what a surprise to find you here the cherub face swung over and up to rake the hair is an exquisite touch sir exquisite i am named kruppe sir kruppe the first he raised a pastry to his mouth and jammed it inthis is lord anomander rake kruppekruppe nodded vigorously then swallowed audibly of course why then you must be quite used to such a lofty stance sir kruppe envies those who can look down upon everyone elseit is easy to fool oneself rake answered into viewing those beneath one as small and insignificant the risks of oversight you might saykruppe might well say assuming the pun was intended but who would disagree that the dragons lot is ever beyond the ken of mere humankind kruppe can only guess at the thrill of flight the wail of high winds the rabbits scurrying below as ones shadow brushes their limited awarenessmy dear kruppe baruk sighed it is but a masksuch is the irony of life kruppe proclaimed raising one pastryfilled hand over his head that one learns to distrust the obvious surrendering instead to insidious suspicion and confused conclusion but is kruppe deceived can an eel swim hurrah these seeming muddy waters are home to kruppe and his eyes are wide with wonder he bowed with a flourish spattering bits of cake over rake and baruk then marched off still talking a survey of the kitchen is in order kruppe suspectsan eel indeed rake said in an amused tone he is a lesson to us all is he notagreed baruk muttered shoulders slumping i need a drink let me get you one excuse meturban orr stood with his back to the wall and surveyed the crowded room he was finding it difficult to relax the last week had been exhausting he still awaited confirmation from the assassins guild that coll was dead it wasnt like them to take so long to complete a contract and sticking a knife into a drunk shouldnt have been too difficulthis hunt for the spy in his organizations had reached a dead end but he remained convinced that such a manor womanexisted again and again and especially since linis assassination hed found his moves in the council blocked by countermoves too unfocused for him to point a finger at any one person but the proclamation was dead in the waterhed come to that conclusion this morning and hed acted even now his most trusted and capable messenger rode the traders track probably passing through the gadrobi hills and that thunderstorm at this very moment on his way to pale to the empire turban orr knew the malazans were on the way no one in darujhistan could stop them and the moons lord had been defeated once at pale why would it be any different this time around no the time had come to ensure that his own position would survive the empires occupation or better yet an even higher rank to reward his vital supporthis eyes fell casually on a guard stationed to one side of the spiral staircase the man looked familiar somehownot his face but the way he stood the set of the shoulders was the mans usual station at majesty hall no the uniform was that of a regular while majesty hall was the domain of the elites turban orrs frown deepened behind the hawk mask then the guard adjusted his helmet strap and turban orr gaspedhe leaned back against the wall overcome by trembling despots barbican all those nights night after nightfor yearsthat guard had witnessed his midnight meetings with his allies and agents there stood his spyhe straightened closing one hand over the pommel of his duelling sword hed leave no room for questions and damn sinitals sensibilitiesand damn this party he wanted his vengeance to be swift and immediate hed let no one stop him his eyes fixing on the unsuspecting guard turban orr stepped forwardhe collided with a hard shoulder and staggered back a large man in a tiger mask turned to him orr waited for an apology but received only silence he moved to step past the manthe strangers arm intercepted him turban orr cursed as a gloved hand poured wine down his chest idiot he snapped i am councilman turban orr out of my wayi know who you are the man said quietlyorr jabbed a finger into the mans chest keep that mask on so ill know who to look for lateri didnt even notice your mask the man said his voice cold and flat fooled by the nose i supposethe councilmans eyes narrowed eager to die are you he grated i will oblige you his hand twitched on his swords pommel in a few minutes right now i havei wait on no man rallick nom said and certainly not for some thinlipped prancer pretending to manhood if youve the belly for a duel make it now or stop wasting time with all this talkshaking turban orr took a step back and faced the man directlywhats your name he demanded hoarselyyou are not fit to hear it councilmanturban orr raised his hands and whirled to the crowd hear me guests unexpected entertainment for you all conversation died and everyone faced the councilman he continued a fool has challenged my honour friends and since when has turban orr permitted such an insulta duel someone cried excitedly voices roseorr pointed at rallick nom this man so bold as to wear trakes face will be dead shortly look upon him now friends as he looks upon youand know that he is all but dead alreadystop babbling rallick drawledthe councilman pulled the mask from his face revealing a tight grinif i could kill you a thousand times he said it would not be enough to satisfy me i must settle with you but oncerallick removed his mask and tossed it on to the carpeted stairs he looked upon turban orr with flat dark eyes done breaking wind councilmanunmasked and still a stranger orr said scowling so be it find yourself a second a thought struck him and he turned back to the crowd searching it towards the back he saw the mask he sought that of a wolf his choosing of a second could well have political benefits assuming the man accepted and in this crowd hed be a fool to deny himfor myself he said loudly i would be honoured if councilman estraysian darle act as my secondthe wolf started beside him stood two women one no more than a girl darles wife was dressed as a veiled woman of callows while the girl had selectedoutrageouslythe minimal garb of a barghast warmaiden both wife and daughter spoke to estraysian he stepped forward the honour is mine he rumbled completing the ritual acceptanceturban orr felt a surge of triumph to have his most powerful enemy in the council at his side for this duel would send a message mixed enough to panic half the council members present pleased at his coup he faced his nameless opponent again and your secondsilence fell over the roomi havent much time lady sinital said in a low voice after all as the hostess for this fte its your duty murmured the man before her to satisfy your guestshe reached forth and brushed the hair from her forehead which is something im certain you can do and do wellshe smiled and walked to the door she locked its latch then spun to face the man again perhaps half an hour she saidthe man strode to the bed and tossed down his leather gloves im confident he said that those thirty minutes will be satisfying indeed each more than the lastlady sinital joined him beside the bed i suppose she whispered as she slipped her arms around the mans neck and drew his face down to her lips that youve no choice now but to tell the widow lini the sad news she touched her lips to his then ran her tongue along the line of his jawmmm what sad news is thatoh that youve found yourself a more worthy lover of course her tongue reached into his ear abruptly she pulled back and met his eyes searchingly do you hear that she askedhe brought his arms around her and drew her closer hear whatthats just it she said its suddenly quiet downstairs id bettertheyre in the garden no doubt the man said reassuringly the minutes are passing ladyshe hesitated then made the mistake of letting him press his body against hers lady simtals eyes widened in nearalarm her breathing changed so she gasped what are we doing still dressedgood question murillio growled pulling both of them on to the bedin the silence following turban orrs question baruk found himself preparing to step forward knowing well what that would reveal he felt compelled nevertheless rallick nom was here to right a dreadful wrongmore the man was a friend closer to the alchemist than kruppe or murillioand in spite of his profession a man of integrity and turban orr was lady sinitals last link to real power if rallick killed the man shed fallcolls return to the council was something baruk and his fellow vorrud mages greatly desired and turban orrs death would be a reliefmore was riding on this duel than rallick imagined the alchemist adjusted his robe and drew a deep breatha large hand closed on his upper arm and before baruk could react lord anomander rake stepped forward i offer my services as second he said loudly he met rallicks eyesthe assassin betrayed nothing not once looking at baruk he answered rakes offer with a nodperhaps turban orr sneered the two strangers know each otherweve never met rake said however i find myself instinctively sharing his distaste for your endless talk councilman thus i seek to avoid a council debate on who will be this mans second shall we proceedturban orr led the way out to the terrace estraysian darle behind him as baruk turned to follow he felt a familiar contact of energies at his side he swung his head and recoiled good gods mammot where did you get that hideous maskthe old mans eyes held his briefly then shied away an accurate rendition of jaghut features i believe he said softly though i think the tusks are a little shortbaruk shook himself have you managed to find your nephew yetno mammot replied i am deeply worried by thatwell the alchemist grunted as they walked outside lets hope that oponns luck holds for the ladof course mammot murmuredwhiskeyjacks eyes widened as a crowd of excited guests poured out from the main chamber and gathered on the terracefiddler scurried to his side its a duel sergeant the guy with the wine stain on his shirt is one of them a councilman named orr nobody knows who the other man is hes over there with that big man in the the sergeant had been leaning arms crossed against one of the marble pillars encircling the fountain but at seeing the tall dragonmasked figure he came near to toppling into the fountain behind himhoods balls he cursed recognize that ionia silver hair

eyes lingering on the tiste and make sure theyve got something handy in case it all comes apart this estates got to burn then hot and long well need the diversion to set off the intersection mines give me the nod telling me theyre up to itright quick ben moved offwhiskeyjack grunted in surprise as a young man stepped round him dressed as a thief complete with face maskexcuse me the man muttered as he walked into the crowdthe sergeant stared after him then glanced back at the garden how the hell had that lad got past them in the first place he couldve sworn theyd sealed off the woods he loosened his sword surreptitiously in its sheathcrokus had no idea what kind of costume challice darle would be wearing and he was resigned to a long hunt held left apsalar at the uampia back wall and now felt guilty still shed seemed to take it well though in a way that made him feel even worse why did she have to kvampe about things a thought about the crowds strange formation looking as he was for a head somewhere at chest level to everyone else as it turned out that proved unnecessary for challice darles costume was no disguisecrokus found himself between two burly house guards across from him twenty feet away with no one to block his view stood challice and an older woman crokus took to be her mother their attention was held unerringly on a tall severelooking man standing at one end of the cleared space and speaking with another man who was strapping on a duelling glove it slowly dawned on the thief that a duel was but moments awaysqueezing between the two guards crokus craned his neck to find the other duellist at first he thought him the giant with the dragon mask and twohanded sword then his gaze found the man rallick nom his eyes snapped back to the first duellist familiar he nudged the guard on his leftis that councilman turban orrit is sir the guard replied an odd tightness in his tonecrokus glanced up to see the mans face wet with sweat trickling down from under his peaked helmet strange so wheres lady sinital he asked casuallynowhere in sight the guard answered with obvious relief otherwise shed stop thiscrokus nodded at that well he said rallick will winthe guards gaze was on him the eyes hard and piercing you know the manwellsomeone tapped his back and he turned to find a cherubs face smiling mindlessly at him why crokus lad what an inventive costume youre wearingkruppewell guessed kruppe replied the painted wooden face swung to the guard oh kind sir i have a written message for you kruppe placed a scroll into the mans hand compliments of a longtime secret admirercrokus grinned these guards had all the luck when it came to noble ladiescircle breaker accepted the scroll and slid from it the silk tie in more than once he had sensed turban orrs eyes on him first in the central chamber when it looked as if the councilman might accost him directly and now while others argued over who should referee the duelcircle breaker prayed rallick would kill turban orr he felt his own fear racing through his body and it was with trembling hands that he read the eels messagethe time has come for circle breaker to retire from active duty the circle is mended loyal friend though you have never seen the eel you have been his most trusted hand and you have earned your restthink not that the eel simply discards you now such is not the eels

exasperation enough of this he bellowedi will referee this duel and accept all responsibility judgement of victory is mine accepted by both partiesturban orr nodded even better than estraysian being his second baruks proclaiming him victor in the duel would be a coup in its own right i acceptas do i rallick said his short cloak drawn about his bodya sudden wind thrashed the treetops in the garden sweeping down from the east thunder boomed from this side of the hills a number of onlookers seemed to flinch turban orr grinned stepping into the cleared area leaves skirled past clattering like tiny bones before it rains he saidhis allies in the crowd laughed at this of course orr continued it might prove more entertaining to draw things out a wound here a wound there shall i cut him to pieces slowly he feigned dismay at the chorus of eager assent too eager for blood friends must the ladies dance on slick flagstones once darkness falls we must consider our host and where was sinital his imagination conjured an image in answer and he frowned no indeed he said coldly it shall be quickthe councilman unsheathed his sword and fastened his gloves leather straps to the ornate grip behind the bell guard he scanned the faces of his audience even now seeking some betrayal of expressionhe had friends who were enemies enemies who would be friends the game would continue beyond this moment but it could prove a telling moment he would recall every face later and study it at his leisureturban orr assumed his stance his opponent stood ten feet away both hands hidden beneath his cloak he looked at ease almost bore whats this orr demanded where is your weaponim ready rallick repliedbaruk placed himself equidistant between the two duellists slightly to one side his face was pale as if he had fallen ill comments from seconds he asked faintlyrake made no replyestraysian darle cleared his throat i hereby make it known that i oppose this duel as facile and trite he stared at turban orr i find the councilmans life irrelevant in the best of times should he die the man looked over to rallick there will be no vengeance pact from the house of darle you sir are freed of thatrallick bowedturban orrs smile tightened the bastard would pay for that he vowed he lowered himself into a crouch ready to launch an attack soon as the duel beganbaruk said you have been heard estraysian darle the alchemist raised a handkerchief before him then released itturban orr jumped forward and lunged in a single fluid motion fast hed fully extended his weapon before the handkerchief struck the paving stones he saw his opponents left hand dart under his blade then twist up and outward a short curved knife flashing in its grip the pa was a blur yet orr caught it and deftly disengaged driving his point i and towards the mans midsection he had no time even to notice the second knife as rallick turned his body sideways the blade in his right hand guiding turban orrs sword past him the assassin stepped in th his left hand moving in a high swing that buried its blade in the councilmans neck rallick followed this by driving his other knife into orrs chestthe councilman staggered to one side his sword clanging on stones as he clutched at the gushing wound in his neck the motion was reflex for he was already dead from the wound in his hearthe toppledrallick stepped back weapons once again hidden beneath his cloak a thousand other deaths he whispered so low that only baruk and rake heard him would not have satisfied me but ill settle for this one baruk stepped close and made to speak but then at a gesture from rake he turned to see estraysian darle approachingthe councilmans heavy eyes held rallick i might suspect he said given your style that we have witnessed an assassination of course even the guild of assassins is brash enough to commit public murder therefore ive no choice but to keep such suspicions to myself and leave it at that good evening gentlemen he whirled and strode awayi think rake said his masked face swinging to the assassin that that was a rather uneven matcha rush of people closed in around turban orrs body voices shouted in dismaybaruk studied the cool satisfaction on rallicks face its done rallick go homea large rounded woman in a bright green goldtrimmed robe joined them unmasked she smiled broadly at baruk greetings she said interesting times yes a personal servant stood at her side bearing a padded tray on which squatted a waterpiperallick stepped back with a slight bow then leftbaruk sighed greetings derudan permit me to introduce lord anomander rake lord the witch derudanforgive the mask rake said to her it is best that it remain on howeversmoke streamed down from derudans nose my compatriots share my growing unease yes we feel the approaching storm and while baruk continues to reassure us still the misgivings yesshould it prove necessary rake said i will attend to the matter personally i do not believe however that our greatest threat is the one beyond the citys walls a suspicion witch no morei think baruk said tentatively that we would like to hear these suspicions of yours rakethe tiste and hesitated then shook his head unwise the matter is presently too sensitive to be broached i shall remain here for now howeverderudan waved dismissively at baruks angry growl true the torrud cabal is unused to feeling helpless yes true also dangers abound and any might prove a feint a diversion yes cunning is the empress for myself i affirm the trust between us lord she smiled at baruk we must speak you and i alchemist she said linking arms with himrake bowed to the woman a pleasure meeting you witch he watched the witch and the alchemist walk away the servant scurrying at derudans heelkruppe intercepted a servant burdened with deliciouslooking savouriestaking two handfuls at random he turned back to resume his conversation with crokus he stopped the lad was nowhere in sightthe crowd milled about on the terrace some upset although the majority appeared simply confused where was lady sinital they askedsome grinning changed the question to whos she with already a new wave of anticipation rose among the nobles they circled like vultures waiting for their faltering hostesssmiling beatifically behind the cherub mask kruppe raised his eyes slowly to the balcony overlooking the patio in time to see a figure appear as a dark feminine silhouette behind the shutters he licked sticky sugar from his fingers smacking his lips there are times kruppe murmurs when celibacy born of sad deprivation becomes a boon nay a source of great relief dear murillio prepare for a stormsinital pushed apart two slats of the shutters and looked down you were right she said they have indeed retired to the terrace odd with that storm coming i should get dressed she returned to the bed and began to collect her clothing which lay scattered all around it and what about you murillio she asked dont you think your companion below is wondering where you are dear lovermurillio swung his legs over the bedside and pulled on his tights i think not he saidsinital shot him a curious look who did you come withjust a friend he answered buttoning his shirt i doubt youd recognize the nameat that moment the doors lock snapped and the door itself slammed inwarddressed only in her underclothes sinital loosed a startled cry her eyes flashed at the tall cloaked man standing in the doorway how dare you enter my bedroom leave at once or ill callboth guards patrolling this hallway have departed lady rallick nom said stepping into the room and closing the door behind him the assassin glanced at murillio get dressed he snappeddeparted sinital moved to place the bed between herself and rallicktheir loyalty has been purchased the assassin said the lesson shouldnt be lost on youi need only scream and others will comebut you havent rallick grinned because youre curiousyou dont dare harm me sinital said straightening turban orr hunt you down the assassin took another step forward im here only to talk lady sinital he said you wont be harmed no matter what you deservedeserve ive done nothingi dont even knowyouneither did councilman lini rallick said quietly and tonight the same could be said for turban orr both men paid for their ignorance alas fortunate that you missed the duel lady it was unpleasant but necessary his eyes hardened on the pale woman allow me to explainturban orrs offer of contract to the assassins guild is now officially cancelled coll lives and now his return to this house is assured youre done with lady sinital turban orr is deadhe turned and walked from the room closing the door behind himmurillio rose slowly he looked into sinitals eyes seeing there a growing terror undermined by the stripping away of her links to power her once secure defences collapsed he watched as she seemed physically to contract her shoulders drawing inward her hands clasped at her stomach knees bendingthen he could look no longer the lady sinital was gone and he dared not study too closely the creature in her placehe unsheathed his ornamental dagger and tossed it on the bedwithout another word or gesture he left the room knowing with certainty that he would have been the last man to see her aliveout in the hallway he paused mowri he said softly im not cut out for this planning to reach this point was one thing having now reached it was another he hadnt considered how hed feel justice got in the way of that a white fire hed had no reason to look behind or push asidejustice had seduced him and he wondered what he had just lost he wondered at the death he felt spreading within him the regret following in that deaths wake so unanswerable it was threatened to overwhelm him mowri he whispered a second time as close to praying as hed ever been i think im now lost am i lostcrokus edged round a marble pillar his eyes on the rather short barghast warmaiden sitting on the fountains rim damn those guards at the woods edge anyway he was a thief wasnt he besides they all looked pretty distractedhe waited for his opportunity and when it came he darted for the shadows between the first line of trees no shout of alarm or call to halt sounded behind him slipping into the darkness crokus turned and crouched yes she still sat there facing in his directionhe drew a deep breath then stood straight a pebble in one handeyeing the guards he waited half a minute later he found his chancehe stepped forward and flung the pebble into the fountainchallice darle jumped then looked round as she wiped droplets of water from her painted facehis heart sank as her gaze passed over him then her head whipped backcrokus gestured desperately this was it this was when hed find out where she stood as far as he was concerned he held his breath and gestured againwith a backward glance towards the patio challice rose and ran to himas she came close she squinted at him gorlas is that you ive been waiting all night crokus froze then without thinking he lunged forward and clasped a hand over her mouth his other arm encircling her waist challice squealed trying to bite his palm and struggled against him but he dragged her into the darkness of the garden now what he wonderedcircle breaker leaned against the marble pillar just inside the estates main chamber behind him guests milled around turban orrs body arguing loudly and voicing empty threats the air hung heavy over the garden smelling of bloodhe wiped at his eyes trying to calm his heart its over queen of dreams im done i can rest now finally rest he straightened slowly taking a deep breath adjusted his sword belt and glanced aroundcaptain stillis was nowhere in sight and the chamber was almost empty except for a knot of servants outside the kitchen entrance lady sinital was still missing and confusion now seeped into the void of her absencecircle breaker looked one last time at the guests in the garden then he made his way to the doors as he passed a long table on which sat the remnants of pastries and puddings he heard faint snoring another step forward brought him to the tables end and into view the small round man seated in a plush antique chair the smeared cherub mask hid the mans face but circle breaker could see the closed eyes and the nasal drone that matched the rise and fall of his chest was loud and steadythe guardsman hesitated then shaking his head he moved onbeyond the gates now within sight waited the streets of darujhistan and freedom now that hed begun his first steps on that path he would let nothing deter himive done my part just another nameless stranger who couldnt run from the face of tyranny dear hood take the mans shrivelled soulhis dreams are over ended by an assassins whim as for my own soul well you shall have to wait a while longerhe passed through the gates welcoming at last the smile that came unbidden to his mouthchapter twentytworavens great

out of sight beyond the hill she was hurting the jaghut tyrant knew the power of her immense lifeforce bleeding awayand now he said through tattered lips she will die raests flesh had been torn away

driven back the dragons hed listened to their cries of pain laughing hed flung dense clouds of earth and stone skyward to blind them he ignited the air in the path of their flight he filled clouds with fire it was he felt good to be alive againas he walked he continued to devastate the land around him a single jerk of his head had shattered a stone bridge spanning a wide shallow river there had

hisseda dubious claim kruppe said even so he is joined in this endeavourthe jaghut tyrant straightened to see a tall blackshrouded figure emerge from the streambed he cocked his head as the apparition approached you remind me of hood is the death wanderer still alive he scowled but no i sense nothing from you you do not existperhaps the figure replied in a deep soft tone that hinted of r if so he continued then neither do you we are both of the jaghut the figure halted fifteen feet away from raest and swung hooded head in the dragons direction her master awaits your arrival jaghut but he waits in vain and for this you should thank us he would deliver a kind of death from which there is no escape even by such a creature as you the head turned and the darkness within the hood once again

raests battered withered body collapsedkrul cocked his head hes found another bodykruppe pulled out his handkerchief oh my he saidkalam gestured sharply and paran ducked down the captains mouth was dry there was something very wrong with this garden he wondered if it was simply the exhaustion he felt the gardens air itself rubbed his senses raw he thought he could see the darkness pulse and the smell of decay had thickened to a stenchkalam reached for his knives paran tensed unable to see anything beyond the assassin too many trees not enough light somewhere ahead flickered gaslamps and people were gathered on the terrace but civilization seemed a thousand leagues away here the captain felt as if he was within a primordial presence breathing slowly and heavily on all sideskalam gestured that paran remain where he was then slipped into the shadows to their right crouching low the captain edged forward to where the assassin had been standing moments earlier there looked to be a glade or clearing just ahead he couldnt be certain however nor could he see anything amiss yet his feeling of wrongness now ached in his skull he took another step something occupied the glades centre blockish like a dressed stone or an altar and before it stood a small woman almost wraithlike in the darkness her back was to paranone moment she stood alone the next kalam rose behind her knives glimmering in his hands he drew back his armsthe woman moved in a blur one elbow driving backwards into the assassins stomach she twisted round and drove her knee into the mans crotch a shout burst from kalam as he reeled back a step then fell to the ground with a heavy thumpparans sword was in his hand he dashed into the clearingthe woman saw him and voiced a surprised frightened yelp no she cried please the captain stopped at that girlish voice kalam sat up he groaned then said dammit sorry wasnt expecting you we figured you were dead girlthe woman eyed paran warily as he approached cautiously i should know you shouldnt i she asked kalam then as paran came closer she raised a frightened hand between them and stepped back ii killed you with a soft moan she fell to her knees your blood was on hands i remember it a fire of rage flared in paran he raised his sword and moved to stand over herwait kalam hissed wait captain somethings not right herewith great difficulty the assassin climbed to his feet then prepared to sit down on the stone blockdont the girl gasped cant you feel iti can paran growled he lowered his weapon dont touch thing corporalkalam stepped away thought it was just me he mutteredits not stone at all the woman said her face free of the anguish that had twisted it a moment before its wood she rose and faced and its growinga suspicion came to paran girl do you remember me do you know who i amshe frowned at him then shook her head hes an old friend i thinkthe assassin choked on something then coughed loudly wagging his headi know kalam she said the woman pointed at the wooden block see its growing againboth men looked a haze blurred the blocks edges swelling and shifting then vanished yet it was clear to paran that the thing was now biggerit has roots the woman addedparan shook himself corporal remain here with the girl i wont be long he sheathed his sword and left the glade after winding through the undergrowth for a minute he came to its edge and looked out on a terrace crowded with guests a lowwalled fountain rose from the paving stones to his left encircled by marble pillars spaced about a yard apartthe captain saw that whiskeyjack and the squad had arrayed themselves in a rough line a dozen feet from the gardens edge facing the terrace they looked tense paran found a dead branch and snapped it in halfat the sound all six men turned the captain pointed at whiskeyjack and mallet then stepped back between the trees the sergeant whispered something to quick ben then he collected the healer and they came overparan pulled whiskeyjack close kalams found sorry and something else besides he said the girls not all there sergeant and i dont think its an act one minute she remembers killing me the next she doesnt and shes got it into her head right now that kalams an old friendmallet gruntedafter a brief glance back at the party whiskeyjack asked so whats this something elseim not sure but its uglyall right the sergeant sighed go with the captain mallet take a look at sorry any contact from the assassins guild yet he asked parannothen we move soon whiskeyjack said we let fiddler and hedge loose bring kalam when you come back mallet we need to talkrallick found his path unobstructed as he moved across the central chamber towards the front doors faces turned to him and conversations fell away rising again as he passed a bonedeep weariness gripped the assassin more than could be accounted for by the blood lost to a wound already healed the malaise gripping him was emotionalhe paused at seeing kruppe rising from a chair mask dangling from one plump hand the mans face was sheathed in sweat and there was fear in his eyesyouve a right to be terrified rallick said approaching him if id known youd be heresilence kruppe snapped kruppe must thinkthe assassin scowled but said nothing hed never before seen kruppe without his usual affable faade and the sight of him so perturbed made rallick profoundly uneasybe on your way friend kruppe said then his voice sounding strange your destiny awaits you more it seems this new world is well prepared for one such as raest no matter what flesh he wearsrallicks scowl deepened the man sounds drunk he sighed then turned away his mind returning once again to what had been achieved this night he continued on his way leaving kruppe behind what now he wondered so much had gone into reaching this moment the sharp focus of his thoughts seemed dulled now by success never the crusader rallicks obsession to right the wrong had been in a sense no more than the assassin assuming the role coll himself should have taken hed played the instrument of colls will relying on a faith that the mans own will would returnand if it didnt his scowl deepening rallick crushed that question before it could lead his thought in search of an answer as baruk had said the time had come to go homeas he passed a silvermasked woman touched his arm startled by the contact he turned to look at her long brown hair surrounded the featureless mask its eyehole slits revealing nothing of what lay behind itthe woman stepped close ive been curious she said quietly for some time however i see now i should have observed you personally rallick nom ocelots death could have been avoidedthe assassins gaze darkened vorcanher head tilted in a fraction of a nodocelot was a fool rallick snapped if orrs contract was sanctioned by the guild i await punishmentshe did not replyrallick waited calmlyyoure a man of few words rallick nomhis answer was silencevorcan laughed softly you say you await punishment as if already resigned to your own death her gaze shifted from him towards the crowded terrace councilman turban orr possessed protective magic yet it availed him naught curious she seemed to be considering something then she nodded your skills are required rallick nom accompany me he blinked then as she strode towards the garden at the rear of the house he followedcrokus held one hand over challices mouth as he lay atop her with his other he removed his thiefs mask her eyes widened in recognition if you scream crokus warned in a harsh voice youll regret ithed managed to drag her perhaps ten yards into the undergrowth before she tripped him theyd thrashed about but hed won the battlei just want to talk to you crokus said i wont hurt you challice i swear it unless you try something of course now im going to remove my hand please dont scream he tried to read the expression in her eyes but all he saw was fear ashamed he raised his handshe didnt scream and a moment later crokus found himself wishing she had damn you thief when my father catches you hell have you skinned alive thats if gorlas doesnt find you first you try anything with me and hell have you boiled slowlycrokus jammed his hand over her mouth again skinned boiledwhos gorlas he demanded glaring some amateur chef so you did betray meshe stared up at himhe lifted his hand againi

otherwise her expression softened crokus i wont betray you it will be our secret for the briefest of moments he felt like a child being stroked and consoled by a kindly matron and he found himself enjoying itbefore you she added smiling id never met a real thief from the his enjoyment ended in a surge of anger hoods breath no he sneered real you dont know whats real challice youve never had blood on your hands youve never seen a man die but thats the way it should be isnt it leave the dirt to us were used to iti saw a man die tonight challice said quietly i never want to again if thats what real means then i dont want it its all yours crokuscrokus stared at her back her braided hair as her words rang in his suddenly exhausted he turned to the garden he hoped apsalar had remained where hed left her the last thing he wanted now was to have to track her down he slipped into the shadowsmallet recoiled with his first step into the glade paran gripped his armthe healer shook his head ill not approach any closer sir whatever lives there is anathema to my denul warren and it it senses me with hunger he wiped sweat from his brow drew a shaky breath best bring the girl to me hereparan released his arm and darted into the clearing the block of wood was now the size of a table veined in thick twisting roots and pocked on its sides with rough squared holes the earth around it looked soaked in blood corporal he whispered chilled send the girl over tokalam laid a hand on her shoulder its all right lass he said in the tone of a kindly uncle you go on now well join you shortlyyes she smiled and moved to where the healer stood at the gladeskalam rubbed his bristly jaw eyes following her never seen sorry smile before he said as paran arrived and thats a shamethey stood and watched as mallet spoke quietly to the girl then stepped forward and laid a hand on her foreheadparan cocked his head the storms stopped he said yeah hope it means what wed like it to meansomeones stopped it i share your hope corporal for the captain however it was a small hope something was building he sighed its not even the twelfth bell yet hard to believelong night ahead of us the assassin said making it clear that he too found himself sorely lacking in optimism he grunted mallet had voiced an amazed cry that reached them the healer drew back his hand and waved at paran and kalam you go the assassin saidthe captain frowned at the black man confused then he went over to where the healer and sorry waited the girls eyes were closed and she seemed in a trancemallet was direct the possessions gone he saidguessed as much paran replied eyeing the girltheres more to it though the healer continued shes got someone else inside her sirparans brows rosesomeone who was there all along how it survived the ropes presence is beyond me and now ive got a choiceexplainmallet crouched found a twig and began to scratch aimless patterns in the dirt that someones been protecting the girls mind acting like an alchemists filter in the last two years sorrys done things that would drive her insane if shed remembered any of it that presence is fighting those memories right now but it needs help because it isnt as strong as it once was its dyingparan squatted beside the man youre thinking of offering that help thennot sure you see sir i dont know its plans dont know what its up to cant read the pattern its trying to make so lets say i help it only what it wants is absolute control then the girls possessed all over againso you think the presence was protecting sorry from the rope only so it could now jump in and take overput it that way mallet said and it doesnt make sense what gets me though is why else would that presence commit itself so thoroughly its body its flesh is gone if it lets go of the girl its got nowhere to go sir now maybe its a loved one a relative or something like that a person who was willing to sacrifice herself absolutely thats a possibilityherself its a womanit was damned if i know what it is now all i get from it is sadnessthe healer met parans eyes its the saddest thing ive ever known sirparan studied the mans face briefly then he rose im not going to give you an order on what to do healerbutbut for what its worth i say do it give it what it needs so it can do what it wants to domallet puffed out his cheeks then tossed down the twig and straightened my instinct too sir thankskalam spoke loudly from the glade far enough show yourselvesthe two men spun around to see kalam looking into the woods to their left paran grasped mallets arm and pulled him into the shadowsthe healer dragged sorry with themtwo figures entered the glade a woman and a mancrokus snaked closer through the vines and mulch of the forest floor for an offlimits garden this was a busy tangle of wood the voices hed heard in his search for apsalar now revealed themselves as two men and one silvermasked woman all three were looking at an odd blurry tree stump in the centre of the glade slowly crokus let out a breath one of the men was rallick nomthere is ill in this the woman said stepping back a hungerthe large blackskinned man at her side grunted wouldnt argue with you on that guild master whatever it is it aint malazanthe thiefs eyes widened malazan spies guild master vorcanseemingly impervious to the strangeness around her the woman now turned to rallick how does it affect you rallickit doesnt he saidapproach it thenthe assassin shrugged and walked up to the writhing knotted blockits blurred movement stoppedvorcan relaxed you seem to damage its efforts rallick curiousthe man grunted otataral dustwhati rubbed it into my skinvorcan staredthe other mans eyes narrowed on rallick i remember you assassin our quarry when we first sought to make contact the night of the ambush from aboverallick noddedwell the malazan continued im surprised you survivedhe is a man of many surprises vorcan said very well corporal kalam of the bridgeburners your request for an audience reached me and i have granted it before we begin however i would appreciate it if the rest of your party were to join us she turned to the trees on her rightcrokuss head was already reelingbridgeburners but it felt moments away from bursting when he saw two men emerge from the shadows with apsalar between them she looked drugged and her eyes were closedone of the men said guild master i am captain paran of the ninth squad he drew a deep breath then continued in this matter however kalam speaks for the empirevorcan turned back to the black man then the audience is begunwe both know guild master that the city council is not darujhistans true power base and since youre not either weve concluded that the citys mages operate covertly keeping the status quo intact being their overriding interest whoever they are theyre good at hiding themselves now we might just decide to kill every mage in darujhistan but that would take too long and it might prove messyinstead guild master the malazan empire has issued a contract on darujhistans true rulers one hundred thousand gold jakatas eachmore the empress offers the mantle of the citys control accompanied with the title high first and all the privileges that come with it he crossed his armsvorcan was silent then she said empress laseen is willing to pay nine hundred thousand jakatas to meif thats the number yes kalam agreedthe torrud cabal is a powerful force corporal but before i answer i would know of the creature who approaches from the east her face tightened fractionally five dragons opposed it for a time presumably hailing from moons spawn i assume that master baruk and his cabal have sealed an agreement with the son of darknesskalam looked stunned then recovered quickly guild master the approaching force was not of our making wed welcome its destruction at the hands of the son of darkness as for your hidden question i would assume that the alliance between the tiste and and the cabal will become void with the death of the cabals members were not asking you to try to kill the lord of moons spawnparan cleared his throat guild master moons spawn and the malazan empire have clashed before the pattern indicates that the son of darkness is likely to retreat rather than stand against us aloneaccurate vorcan agreed corporal kalam i have no wish to waste the lives of my assassins on such an effort only an assassin who is a high mage could hope to succeed therefore i accept the contract i will conduct the assassinations now as to the matter of paymentdelivered by warren upon completion of the contract kalam said you may know this already guild master but the empress was once an assassin she abides by the rules of conduct the gold shall be paid the title and rule of darujhistan given without hesitationaccepted corporal kalam vorcan turned to rallick i begin immediately rallick nom the task i now give you is vital i have considered your strange ability to negate the growth of this ill thing my instincts are such it must not be permitted to continue growing you will remain here thus holding it in stasisfor how long he growleduntil my return at that time i will test its defences oh and one more thing ocelots actions were not sanctioned by the guild executing him fulfilled the guilds judgement as to fit punishment thank you rallick nom the guild is pleasedrallick walked over to the strange stump and sat down on ituntil later vorcan said and strode from the gladecrokus watched as the three malazan spies gathered for a whispered discussion then one of the men grasped apsalars arm and gently guided her into the woods making for the rear wall the remaining two captain paran and corporal kalam glanced over at rallickthe assassins head was in his hands his elbows on his thighs staring gloomily at the groundkalam hissed a sigh through his teeth and shook his head a moment later both men left in the direction of the terracecrokus hesitated a part of him wanting to rush into the glade and confront rallick assassinate the mages hand darujhistan to the malazans how could the man allow such a thing to happen he did not move however a fear growing inside him that he in truth knew nothing of this man would the assassin listen to him or would he answer crokus with a knife in the throat crokus didnt feel like taking chancein the last minute rallick had not moved then he rose turned directly to where crokus lay hiddenthe thief groanedrallick beckonedslowly crokus approachedyou hide well rallick said and you were lucky vorcan kept her mask onshe couldnt see much out of it you heard thencrokus nodded his eyes drawn to what hed called a tree stump in spite of himself it looked more like a small wooden house the pocks on its sides could well have been windows unlike vorcan he sensed not hunger but a kind of urgency almost frustrationbefore you condemn me listen carefully crokusthe thief dragged his attentioh from the wooden block im listeningbaruk may yet be at the party you must find him tell him exactly whats happened tell him vorcan is a high mageand shell kill them all unless they gather to defend each other the assassin reached out a hand to crokuss shoulder the boy flinched his eyes wary and if baruk has gone home find mammot i saw him here not long ago he wears the mask of a tusked beastuncle mammot but heshes a high priest of driss crokus and a member of the torrud cabal now hurry theres no time to wasteyou mean youre going to stay here rallick just sit there on that that stumpthe assassins grip tightened vorcan spoke true lad whatever this thing is it seems i can hold it in check baruk needs to know of this conjuring i trust his senses more than i do vorcans but for now i will obey her in thisfor a moment crokus resisted his thoughts on apsalar theyd done something to her he was certainand if theyd harmed her hed make them pay but uncle mammot vorcan was planning to kill his uncle the thiefs eyes hardened as he looked up at rallick consider it done he saidat that instant a roar of rage and agony coming from the terrace shook the trees the block of wood behind them responded with a burst of bright yellow fire its roots writhing and swelling like groping fingersrallick pushed crokus hard then whirled and dived on to the blockthe yellow fire winked out and cracks opened in the earth spreading in all directions go yelled rallickthe thief his heart hammering turned and sprinted for lady sinitals estateangrily baruks hand snapped out and yanked savagely on the bell cord above him he heard the wagoner cry out the carriage skidded to a haltsomethings happened he hissed to rake we left too early dammithe moved on the seat to the window and opened its shuttersa moment alchemist rake said levelly his brows knitted and his head cocked as if listening for something the tyrant he pronounced but he is weakened and enough mages remain to deal with him he opened his mouth to add something then shut it again his eyes deepened to azure as he studied the alchemist baruk he said quietly return to your estate prepare for the empires next movewell not have long to waitbaruk stared at the tiste and tell me whats happening he said y will you challenge the tyrant or notrake tossed his mask on to the floor between them and clasped the collar of his cloak if it proves necessary i shallfists pounded on the carriage and voices shouted goodnaturedly the crowds around them pushed in on all sides rocking the carriage the festival approached the twelfth bell the hour of ascension as the lady of spring took to the sky in the coming of the moonrake continued in the meantime the citys streets must be cleared he said i imagine its your desire to minimize the loss of lifeand this is all you give me rake baruk gestured sharply clear the streets how in hoods name do we manage that there are three hundred thousand people in darujhistan and theyre all in the streetsthe tiste and opened the door beside him then leave that to me i need to find a high vantagepoint alchemist suggestionsbaruks frustration was so great that he had to fight the desire to defy anomander rake kruls belfry he said a square tower near worry gaterake stepped out of the carriage well speak again at your estate alchemist he said leaning back inside you and your fellow mages must prepare yourselves he faced the crowds pausing for a moment as if smelling the air how far to this belfrythree hundred pacessurely you dont mean to go on footi do i am not yet ready to unveil my warrenbut how baruk fell silent as anomander rake provided the answer to his questionstanding head and shoulders above the jostling crowds he unsheathed his sword if you value your souls the son of darkness bellowed make way raised high the sword groaned awake chains of smoke writhing from the blade a terrible sound as of wheels creaking filled the air and behind it arose a chorus of moaning filled with hopelessness before lord anomander rake the crowd in the street shrank back all thoughts of festivity swept awaygods forfend baruk whisperedit had begun innocently enough quick ben and whiskeyjack stood together near the fountain servants scurried as despite the nights bloodshed and the hostesss absence the partys energy burgeoned anew as the twelfth bell approached they were joined by captain paranwe have met with the guild master he said she has accepted the contractwhiskeyjack grunted where would we all be without greedi just noticed something quick ben said my headaches gone im tempted to access my warren sergeant see what i can seewhiskeyjack thought briefly go aheadquick ben stepped back into the shadow of a marble pillarbefore them an old man wearing a ghastly mask drifted towards whiskeyjacks line of men then a large buxom woman with a waterpipe approached the old man her servant followed half a step behindtrailing smoke as she walked she called to the old manthe next moment the night was shattered as a wave of energy flowed like a stream of water between whiskeyjack and paran striking the old man in the chest the sergeants sword was in his hand as he turned to find his wizard magic swirling from him pushing him to one side and racing for the woman no quick ben screamed stay away from him paran too had unsheathed his sword in his hand the blade keening as if filled with terror he sprinted forwarda bestial roar of rage shook the air as the old man his mask torn away whirled his burning eyes found the woman and he flung a hand towards her the surge of power that streamed from him was as grey as slate crackling in the airwhiskeyjack frozen watched in disbelief as quick bens body hurled into the womans both collided with the servant and all three went down in a heap the writhing stream of energy cut a swath through the stunned crowd incinerating everyone it touched where men and women had stood a moment earlier there was nothing but white ash the attack branched out ripping through everything in sight trees disintegrated stone and marble exploded in clouds of dust people died some with parts of their body simply gone blood spraying in black flecks as they crumpleda lance of energy shot wildly skyward flashing in the night sky within a heavy cloud another struck the estate with a rattling boom a third snaked towards paran as he closed the gap between him and the old manthe power struck the sword and it and paran vanishedthe sergeant took a halfstep forward then something hard and massive struck a glancing blow to his shoulder he was spun round his right knee buckling inward as he fellhe felt the snap of bone then the meaty tearing of flesh and skin as his weight bore him down his sword clanged agony lancing through him he rolled to free his pinned leg and came up against a toppled pillaran instant later hands grasped his cloak i got you fiddler gruntedwhiskeyjack bellowed in pain as the saboteur dragged him across the pavingstones then darkness swept in around him and he knew no morequick ben found himself buried beneath flesh and for a second he could not breathe then the womans hands pressed down on his shoulders and she pushed herself off him she shouted at the old manmammot anikaleth araestquick bens eyes widened as he sensed the wave of power rise through her body the air suddenly smelled of deep forest loamaraest she yelled and the power burst from her in a virulent pulsequick ben heard mammots scream of painattend wizard the woman said he is jaghutpossessedi know he growled rolling on to his stomach then climbing to his hands and knees a quick glance showed mammot on the ground waving a feeble hand the wizards gaze flicked to where whiskeyjack had been the pillars around the fountain had toppled and the sergeant was nowhere in sight in fact he realized none of the squad was visibleon the terrace crumpled bodies lay in grotesque piles none movingeveryone else had fledmammot recovers the woman said desperately i have nothing left wizard you must do something now yeshe stared at herparan stumbled slid across greasy clay and rolled up against a bank of tufted reeds a storm racked the sky above him he scrambled to his feet the sword chance hot and moaning in his hand a calm shallow lake stretched out on his left ending in a distant ridge of faintly luminescent green to his right the marshes continued out to the horizon the air was cool sweet with decayparan sighed shakily he studied the storm overhead jagged arcs of lightning warred with each other the clouds dark and twisting as if in agony a concussion sounded to his right and he spun a thousand paces away something had appeared the captain squinted it rose above the marsh grasses like an animated tree gnarled and black pulling at the roots that gripped it and flinging them aside another figure appeared danced lithely around it a brownbladed jagged sword in its hands this figure was clearly in retreat as the gnarled manshape lashed at it with miasmic waves of power they were approaching parans positionhe heard bubbling sucking sounds behind him and turned hoods breatha house was rising out of the lake swamp grass and mud slid from its battered stone walls a huge stone doorway gaped black hissing with steam the second level of the structure looked misshapen scarred the cut stones melted away here and there revealing a skeletal wooden another explosion drew his attention back to the fighters they were much closer now and paran could see the figure with the twohanded sword clearly a tlan imass despite its awesome skill with the chalcedony weapon in its hands it was being driven back its attacker was a tall lean creature with flesh like oak two gleaming tusks rose from its lower jaw and it was shrieking with rage it struck the tlan imass again flinging the warrior fifteen paces to roll through the muck and come to rest almost at parans feetthe captain found himself staring down into depthless eyesthe azath is not yet ready mortal the tlan imass said too young not yet of strength to imprison that which called it into beingthe finnest when the tyrant fled i sought out its power it tried to rise failed defend the azath the finnest seeks to destroy itparan looked up to see the apparition stalking towards him defend against that the choice was taken from him the finnest roared and a sizzling wave of power rolled towards him he swung chance into its paththe blade slid through the energy unaffected the power swept over then into paran blinded he screamed as bitter cold lanced through him shattering his thoughts his sense of self an invisible hand closed around his soul mine the word rang in his head triumphant and filled with savage glee you are mineparan dropped chance fell to his knees the grip on his soul was absolute he could only obey fragments of awareness reached througha tool nothing more all i have done all i have survived to reach but thisdeep within him he heard a sound repeating again and again growing louder a howl the chill of his blood that had seamlessly filled every part of his body began to break apart flashes of heat bestial and defiant ripped through the cold he threw back his head the howling reaching his throat as it broke loose the finnest staggered backblood of a hound blood no one can enslaveparan launched himself at the finnest his muscles filled with pain as overwhelming strength flowed into them you dare he struck the creature driving it to the ground battering its oak flesh with his fists sinking his teeth into the bark of its face the finnest tried to push him away and failed it screamed flailing its limbs paran began ripping it methodically to piecesa hand closed on the collar of his cloak pulled him from the tattered body frenzied paran tried to twist round to rend the creature holding him the tlan imass shook him ceasethe captain blinkedcease you cannot destroy the finnest but you have held it long enough the azath will take it now do you understandparan sagged the fires within him ebbing glancing down at the finnest he saw roots and fibrous tendrils rising from the wet earth to wrap themselves around the battered apparition and begin to pull their captive down into the cloying mud in a moment the finnest was gonethe tlan imass released paran and stepped back it regarded him steadily for a long momentparan spat blood and splinters from his mouth wiped his lips with the back of a hand he bent down and retrieved chance damned luck turned he mumbled sheathing the weapon do you have something to say imassyou are a long way from home mortalparan reappeared a moment later staggering halfblind across the terrace then collapsing in a heap quick ben scowled what in hoods breath happened to hima jaghut curse escaped mammot fierce as if ripped from the soul the old man regained his feet trembling with rage then his hooded eyes were on the wizardawaken the seven within me quick ben roared then shrieked as seven warrens opened within him his agonized scream rode the cascading waves of power as they swept across the terracethe jaghut possessed threw up his arms before his face as the waves struck mammots body withered beneath the clambering frenzied attack flesh was ripped away fires lancing boring holes through himhe was driven to his knees a vortex swirling like madness around him mammot howled raising a fist that was nothing but charred bonethe fist spasmed and one of quick bens warrens slammed shut the fist jerked againquick ben sagged im donederudan grabbed a handful of the wizards cloak wizard listen to meanother warren was driven away quick ben shook his head donelisten that manthe one over therewhats he doingquick ben looked up hoods breath he yelled in sudden terror a dozen paces away crouched hedge only his head and shoulders showing behind a bench the saboteurs eyes shone with a manic glaze that the wizard recognized and a large bulky arbalest was in his hands point directly at mammota wordless wailing scream came from hedgethe wizard shouted and dived for the woman a second time as he flew through the air he heard the thock of the saboteurs crossbow quick ben closed his eyes before colliding once again with the womancrone flew tight circles over the plain where the jaghut tyrant had beenhe had reached to within fifty paces of silanah then vanished not a flight through a warren but a vanishing more complete more absolute and all the more fascinating for thatit had been a glorious night a battle worthy of remembrance and its end proved no end at all delicious mystery she cackled crone knew her presence was demanded elsewhere but she was reluctant to leavesuch terrible energies i have witnessed she laughed i mock the waste the sheer foolishness ah and now all that remains is questions questionsshe craned her head upward her lords two tiste and soletaken remained overhead no one wanted to leave before the truth of the jaghut tyrants fate was revealed theyd earned the right to witness it though crone was beginning to suspect such answers would never comesilanah loosed a keening cry then rose from the ground the warren that birthed her flight a strong pungent exhalation the red dragons head swung westward and she voiced a second crywith a mad flap of wings crone brought her descent under control then skirted the tattered ground she climbed skyward again and saw what silanah had seen crone shrieked in joy and anticipationand surprise and now it comes it comesas he shut his eyes quick ben collapsed the last of his warrens the womans arms closed around him as he struck her she grunted loudly and collapsed beneath his momentumthe detonation snatched the air from his lungs the stones under them jumped and a flash of fire and flying masonry filled their world to the exclusion of all else then everything was stillquick ben sat up he looked to where mammot had been standingthe paving stones were gone and a wide deep steaming hole now yawned near the shattered fountain the old man was nowhere in sightdear wizard the woman murmured beneath him we livequick ben glanced down at her

finding the wizard where is whiskeyjack he demandedin the woods hedge answeredparan stumbled in that directionbig help he was hedge mutteredquick the wizard turned to see kalam approach the assassin paused as he skirted the edge of the crater then he said somethings moving down therepaling quick ben rose then helped the witch to her feetthey approached the crater impossible the wizard breathed a manshaped form had coalesced at the base of the pit were dead or worsethrashing from the garden drew their attention the three froze as strangely blurred roots broke free of the undergrowth and snaked hungrily towards the craterthe jaghut possessed straightened spreading grey swirling armsthe roots closed around the creature it shrieked in sudden terrorazath edieirmarn no youve taken my finnestbut leave me pleasetendrils clambered in a frenzy entwining its limbs the omtose phellack power writhed in a panicked effort to escape to no avail the roots pulled the apparition down then dragged it

blowwhiskeyjacks hurt quick ben askedbroken leg fiddler answered pretty badat a surprised cry from derudan who had gone to the opposite side of the fountain they all turned shed walked on to a blackclad youth who must have been crouching behind the fountains stone wall darting like a rabbit the boy leaped the fountain and raced towards the estatewhat do you think he heard fiddler wonderednothing that would mean much to him said quick ben recalling their conversation you and hedge going to do the deedsky high fiddler grinnedthe two saboteurs checked their equipment one last time then turned to the patiomeanwhile kalam stood glowering into the pit ancient copper waterpipes streamed water down its ragged sides for some reason a memory of the greyfaces flashed into his head the assassin crouched seeing one pipe that leaked no water he sniffed the air then lay flat on the ground and reached down to lay his hand over the pipes broken endosserc he breathedhe rolled and gained his feet then asked quick ben where are theythe wizards expression was blank whokalam roared the saboteurs dammitjust left quick ben replied bemused through the estateto the back wall soldier

greyfaces the gas quick benkalam whirled and crossed the patio a moment later he disappeared into the estate housequick ben stared after him the gas his eyes widened well all go sky high he whispered the whole damn citychapter twentythreeit was said she turned the blade on herself then to steal the magic of lifecall to shadow ixfelisin bexhausted paran made his way through the undergrowthhe ducked beneath a tree into shadowand the world shiftedjaws closed on his left shoulder teeth grinding through chain and lifted him from the ground a surge of unseen muscle flung him through the air he landed heavily rolled to his knees and looked up in time to see the hound close once again parans left arm was numb he reached vainly for his sword as the hound opened its maw and closed it around his chest mail popped flesh tore and blood sprayed as the hound lifted paran once againthe captain hung in the giant beasts mouth he felt chance slide free of its scabbard its weight pulling it away from his twitching hand the hound shook him blood spattered the ground then it dropped him and stepped back looking almost baffled it whined began to pace back and forth eyes darting again and again to the captainpain surged through paran in growing waves his limbs shook uncontrollably he could barely draw breathit seems rood must find someone to blame a voice said paran blinked opened his eyes to see a blackcowled man standing above himbut he was premature and for that i apologize evidently some old scores need settling between you and the hounds the man frowned at rood more something has confused him about you kinship now how could that beyou were the one paran said as numbness spread through him the one who possessed the girlthe man faced the captain yes i am cotillion shadowthrone regrets leaving you outside hoods gatesat the cost of two hounds do you realize that those precious creatures had lived for a thousand years do you realize that no manmortal or ascendanthas ever before killed a hounddid i save their souls wouldnt telling that story matter no too much like begging paran glanced at rood kinship what do you want from me he asked cotillion my death leave me here then its almost doneyou should have left us to our work captain since you now hate the empress sowhat you did to the girlwhat i did was merciful i used her yes but she knew it not can the same be said for you tell me is knowing youre being used better than not knowingparan said nothingi can release to the girl all those memories if you like the memories of what i did what she did when i possessed her nocotillion noddedparan could feel the pain returning and it surprised him hed lost so much blood that hed expected to be fading from consciousness by nowinstead the pain was back incessant throbbing amid unbearable itching he coughed now whatnow cotillion seemed surprised now i start againanother girl like herno the plan was flawedyou stole her life cotillions dark eyes hardened now she has it back i see you still carry chance so the same cannot be said for youparan turned his head found the weapon an arms length away when my luck turns he muttered and turn it did he found he could move his left arm and the pain in his chest seemed less insistent than it hadcotillion laughed drily at parans words it will be too late then captain you gamble that the lady continues to look kindly on you youve surrendered whatever wisdom you may have once possessed such is the power of the twinsi am healing paran saidso you are as i said rood was prematurethe captain slowly cautiously sat up his chain armour was in shreds but beneath he could see the red flame of newly healed flesh ii dont understand you cotillion or shadowthroneyou are not alone in that now as to chance paran looked down at the weapon its yours if you want itah cotillion smiled stepping over to pick it up id suspected a change of heart captain the world is so complex isnt it tell me do you pity the ones who used youparan closed his eyes a terrible burden seemed to drain from him he recalled the finnests grip on his soul he glanced up at the hound in roods eyes he saw something almost soft nowisdom returns quickly cotillion said once the bond is severed i will return you now captain with this one last warning try not to be noticed and when next you see a hound runthe air swirled into darkness around paran he blinked saw the trees of the estate garden rising before him i wonder will i run from it or with itcaptain it was mallets voice where in hoods name are youparan sat up not in hoods name mallet im here in the shadowsthe healer scrambled to his side weve got trouble everywhere you lookdeal with it the captain barked climbing to his feetmallet stared at paran hoods breath you look chewed to pieces sirim going after lorn if we all live through this we will meet at the phoenix inn understoodmallet blinked yes sirparan turned to leavecaptainwhat dont treat her kindly sirparan moved offthe images remained with crokus brutally sharp they returned again and again even as he tried to move away from them his thoughts driven by panic and desperationuncle mammot was dead in the youths head a distant steady voice told him that the man who had borne mammots face was not the man hed known all his life and that what had been claimed by the roots was something else something horrific the voice repeated this and he heard its clear statement rising and falling beneath the storm of what he had seen with his own eyes the images that would not leave himthe central chamber of lady sinitals estate was abandoned the ftes trappings scattered about on the floor amid puddles and smears of blood the dead and those whom mammot had hurt had been carried away by the guards the servants had all fledcrokus raced across the room to the open front doors beyond torchlight cast a hissing blue glow down on to the walkways paved stones and the gates which had been left ajar the thief leaped down the steps and hurried for the gate he slowed as he approached it for something was wrong in the streetlike sinitals main floor the street was empty littered with pennants banners and fetishes eddies of dry wind whipped tatters of cloth and reed paper about in dancing circles the air felt heavy and closecrokus emerged on to the street in either direction as far as he could see not a single reveller was visible and a thick silence hung over allthe wind curled round him first from one direction then from another as if seeking escape a charnel smell filled the airmammots death returned to him he felt utterly alone yet rallicks words urged him on days ago the assassin had closed angry hands on the thiefs shirt pulling him closeand hed called crokus a drinker of the citys blood he wanted to refute that especially now darujhistan mattered it was his home and it matteredhe turned in the direction of baruks estate at least with the streets empty this wouldnt take long he began to runthe gusting wind beat against him whipping his hair into his facedarkness hung low above the streets gas lamps crokus skidded to a halt on a corner hed heard something cocking his head he held his breath and listened there again birdshundreds of them from the sound murmuring talking clucking and amid the charnel smell he now detected the reek of birds nests crokus frowned thinking then he looked directly overheada shout broke from his lips and he ducked instinctively above him blotting out the night skys stars was a ceiling of jagged black stone hanging so low as to seem inches from the highest buildings he stared up at it then pulled away his gaze as a wave of dizziness spun through him the ceiling was revolving slowly in its pocks shelves and crags hed seen the restless motion of nesting ravens oily blots against the grainy backgroundmoons spawn had arrived to clear the streets to silence the festival of rebirth what could it mean crokus didnt know but baruk wouldof coursethe thief resumed his run his moccasins a whisper on the cobbleskruppe took an expansive breath his eyes bright as he surveyed the hastily abandoned leavings in the kitchen always the way of things he sighed patting his stomach ever and anon kruppes dreams come truegranted the pattern still finds shape but kruppe senses that all is well with the world symbolized by the vision of bounty now arrayed before his renewed appetites rigours of the flesh demand replenishment after allhe drew another satisfied breath of the steamy air we must needs await at the end the spin of a coin in the meantime of course wondrous food beckonsin an alley facing the gates of lady sinitals estate adjunct lorn had watched the coin bearer appear and a slow satisfied smile spread over her lips finding the boy had been one thing but shed had no desire to enter the garden where shed buried the finnestminutes earlier shed sensed the death of the jaghut tyrant had the lord of moons spawn been drawn into the battle she hoped so it had been her hope that the jaghut would reach the city perhaps even retrieve the finnest thus challenging the son of darkness as an equal in retrospect however she realized that the lord would never have permitted thatwhich meant that whiskeyjack still lived well thered be another time for that once the city was in the hands of the empress and tayschrenn perhaps then theyd find no need to disguise their efforts they could make the arrest a public spectacle with this coup even dujek could not challenge themshed watched the coin bearer race down the street seeming not even to have noticed moons spawn hanging so close overhead a moment later she followed with the coin in her hands the empress would bring oponn to its kneeslike a drowning voice deep within her mind came a question heavy with dismay and despair what of your doubts what of the woman whod once challenged tayschrenn in pale has so much changed has so much been destroyedthe adjunct shook her head dispelling the plaintive cries she was the arm of the empress the woman called lorn was dead had been dead for years and would remain forever dead and now the adjunct moved through these hollow shadows in a city cowering in fear the adjunct was a weapon its edge could bite deep or it could snap break she might once have called the latter death now it was no more than the misfortune of war a flaw in the weapons designshe paused and hid against a wall as the coin bearer stopped on a corner and realized for the first time what hovered above him she considered attacking now while he was so confused possibly terrified but then he continued onthe adjunct crouched down time for tayschrenns gambithopefully the jaghut tyrant had managed to inflict damage upon the moons lord she removed a small flask from her shirt and held the patinated glass up to the shine of gaslight the contents swirled like trapped smoke as she gave it a shakeshe rose and threw it across the street the flask struck a stone wall and shattered glowing red smoke curled upward slowly taking shapethe adjunct spoke you know your task lord of the galayn succeed and freedom will be yoursshe unsheathed her sword and closed her eyes briefly locating the coin bearer in her mind he was fast but she was faster the adjunct smiled again now the coin would be herswhen she moved it was as a blur quicker than any eye could follow even that of a galayn lord loose on the material planein his study baruk cradled his head in his hands mammots death had come like a knife to his own heart and he still felt its stabbing pain he was alone in the chamber having dismissed roald earlierrake had suspected hed refused to speak of it considering it too sensitive a matter the alchemist had wearily to admit that the tiste and had been correct would he even have believed rakeundoubtedly the power possessing mammot had shielded itself defying detection rake had anticipated baruks anger at such a suggestion and had wisely and with compassion chosen to say nothingand now mammot was dead even as was the jaghut tyrant had it been rake who had killed his old friend if so he hadnt used his sword yet another mercy granted both mammot and barukthe alchemist had sensed if anything a kind of relief in mammots death crya soft cough at the door alerted him baruk rose swiftly and turnedhis brows rose witch derudanher face was pale her smile wan i thought of you upon mammots end i am here so alas she said as she strode to a chair by the fireplace and set her waterpipe down on the floor beside it my servant has taken the rest of the evening off she removed the ashcup and tapped its contents into the unlit hearth such mundane exertions she said sighingat first baruk resented her intrusion he preferred to mourn alonebut as he watched her the supple grace of her movements his thoughts changed her warren was tennes ancient and bound to the cycles of seasons and among the handful of deities she could call upon was tennerock the boar of five tusks derudans greatest powerthe one she shared in any casewas the tusk named love he chastised himself slow had the realization come that she was bringing him a giftderudan replaced the ashcup and packed it with leaves she closed a hand around it and the contents glowed with sudden heat a moment later the witch sat heavily in the chair she drew deeply on the mouthpiecebaruk strode to the other chair rake believes it isnt yet over he said sittingshe nodded i was witness to mammots end yes he was opposed by myself and a most remarkable wizard the flesh that was mammot was destroyed by a moranth incendiary the jaghut spirit survived but was taken by an azath her heavylidded eyes appraised himazath here in darujhistanindeed such mysterious conjurings known for their hunger for mages will impose upon our efforts a certain caution yeswhere has it arisenin the garden of sinitals estate did i not also mention a moranth incendiary lady sinitals fte had some unusual guests yesmalazanstwice my life savedthe wizard of whom i spoke who commands within him seven warrensseven baruk said flinching hoods breath is that even possibleif they mean ill it shall fall to the son of darkness to meet the challengeboth stiffened as power surged into life somewhere nearby the alchemist was on his feet fists clenched a demon is unleashed he hissedi feel it as well derudan said her face white of great powera demon lord baruk nodded this is what rake awaitedderudans eyes widened and she pulled on her mouthpiece before asking is he capable of defeating such a creature son of darkness he is but feel this creatures power yesi dont know baruk said quietly if not then the city is doomedat that point there came another blow followed by another the witch and the alchemist stared at each other in recognition two of their cabal had just died violent deathsparal she whispered in fearand tholas baruk said its begun and damn rake for being so rightshe looked at him blanklybaruk grimaced vorcanstanding on the stained pitted bronze tiles of the belfrys roof anomander rakes head snapped around his eyes deepened to blackthe wind clawed at his long silver hair and his grey cloak its moan hollow and lost he raised his gaze momentarily to moons spawn as it moved west he could feel its pain as if the wounds it had received at pale were somehow echoed in his own body a flash of regret crossed his lean featuresair buffeted him and he heard the heavy flap of wings rake smiledsilanah he said softly knowing she would hear him the red dragon slipped between two towers and banked returning to his position i know you sense the demon lords presence silanah you would help me in this i know i know he shook his head return to moons spawn dear friend this battle is mine yours is done but know this if i fail you may seek to avenge my deathsilanah swept overhead and loosed a thin wailgo home rake whisperedthe red dragon cried again then swung westward and rose through the night airhe sensed a presence at his side and turned to find a tall hooded man sharing his view of the city below unwise rake murmured to appear unannouncedthe man sighed the stones beneath your feet lord are newly sanctified i am rebornthere is no place in the world for an eldering god rake said take my word for itkrul nodded i know i anticipated returning to the realms of chaos with a jaghut tyrant for company alas he evaded meand found imprisonment elsewherei am relievedthe two were silent for a long minute then krul sighed i am lost in this world in this timerake grunted you are not alone with those sentiments eldering onedo i follow in your steps lord do i seek out new battles new games to play in the company of ascendants are you rewarded in spirit for your effortssometimes rake said quietly but mostly no i am notthe hooded face turned to the tiste and then whyi know no other way of livingi have no means of assisting you this night anomander rake i am manifest in this sanctified place and manifest in a lone mortals dreams but nowhere elsei will do my best then rake said to avoid damaging your templekrul bowed then vanishedalone once again rake turned his attention to the street below an apparition arrived it paused to sniff the air then began changingveering a lord of the galayn and a soletakenwell the lord of moons spawn growled so am i the tiste and spread his arms wide then rose upward kurald galain sorcery swirled around him blending his clothing his massive sword drawing all inward to the shape he now climbed towards the veering was smooth eloquent as jetblack wings unfolded from his shoulders flesh and bone surged in size changed in shapeas he flew higher eyes fixed on the stars anomander rake became a black dragon silvermaned and dwarfing even silanah his eyes gleamed silver the vertical slits of the pupils dilating his breath gusted in heavy grunts the snap of his wings loud amid the deep groan of muscle on bone his chest swelled to draw in the cold dry air and power filled his beingrake climbed ever higher slipping through a stray cloud that scudded in darkness over the city when he finally tilted his wings forward and caressed the surface of a wayward wind he looked down on a city that glimmered like a mottled copper coin at the bottom of a pellucid pondsorcery flared occasionally centred mostly in the estate district and rake sensed death within those emanations he considered the message delivered by serrat courtesy of a foul mage hed thought a thousand leagues away was the sorcery the work of these unwelcome intrudershe rumbled in frustrationhe would deal with them later before him now was a battle the empress and her empire had challenged him again and again wilful in the desire to test his strength each time hed withdrawn unwilling to commit himself very well empress my patience is at an endthe membrane of his wings tautened the joints creaking as he grunted a straining breath he hung almost motionless for a second studying the great city beneath him then tucking in his wings anomander rake the son of darkness and lord of moons spawn plummetedkalam knew the pattern of detonation the saboteurs would follow he skirted one side of the street as he ran so what if moons spawn hung over them as if ready to descend on the city and crush the life from it like a gods heelfiddler and hedge wouldnt give a danm they had a job to dothe assassin cursed every stubborn bone in their heads why didnt they run away like normal sane people he came to a corner and crossed the intersection diagonally ahead at the far end of the street rose majesty hill as he reached the corner he almost collided with the two saboteurs fiddler darted to one side of him hedge to the other running as if not even recognizing him terror plain on their faceskalam reached back and with each hand grasped a cloaks hood then he grunted in pain as the two men jerked him backward and off his feetdamn you bastards he yelled hold it its kal hedge yelledkalam twisted around to find a rusty shortsword inches from his face with fiddlers white face and wide eyes immediately behind it put that piece of junk away the assassin snapped you want to give me an infectionwere getting out of here hedge hissed forget the damn mines forget everythingstill gripping their cloaks kalam shook them both calm down whats happenedfiddler moaned and pointed up the streetturning kalam stiffeneda twelvefoottall creature shambled down the middle of the road hunched shoulders wrapped in a glittering cape with a high cowl a twobladed axe was slung in its wide dragonhide belt its handle as long as kalam was tall the creatures wide squat face held two slitted eyesoh hoods gates and back the assassin muttered thats tayschrenns precious lord he pushed the two saboteurs around the corner get moving back to sinitals estate neither objected and moments later were running as fast as they could down the street kalam crouched at the corner and waited for the galayn lord to come into viewwhen it did he blanched soletakenthe galayn was assuming a form better suited to wholesale destruction the dunbrown dragon paused its wingtips brushing the buildings on either side its rumble trembled the cobbleskalam watched as the creature tensed its limbs then rose upward on a wave of power the darkness swallowed it hoods breath he said now things are going to get messy he whirled and ran to catch up with the saboteursthe coin bearer came to a street lined with walled estates he slowed his pace studying each structure he passedthe time had come the adjunct knew before the boy had a chance to get inside one of those places where he might find protection she adjusted her grip on the sword padding in silence not fifteen feet behind himshe drew a long deep breath then surged forward swords point extendedat the sharp ringing clang of metal immediately behind him crokus dived forward he dipped a shoulder and rolled regaining his feet he cried out in shock the woman who had attacked coll in the hills was in a whirlwind exchange with a tall roundshouldered man with two scimitarsthe thiefs jaw dropped as he watched the fight as good as the woman had shown herself against coll she was now being driven back as a flurry of attacks swept around her they both moved so quickly that crokus could not even see the parries or the blades themselves but as he watched he saw the blossoming of wounds on the womanher arms legs chest her expression held complete disbeliefthen a voice chuckled beside him hes good aint hecrokus whirled to see a tall thin man wearing a grey and crimson longcoat his hands in its pockets he swung a narrow hatchet face to the thief and grinned you headin somewhere boy somewhere safecrokus nodded numblythe mans grin widened ill escort you then and dont worry youre covered from the roofs too cowls up there damn his snakeskin hide but hes a powerful mage anyway serrat was furious i hear lets walk thencrokus let the man take his arm and lead him away from the duel the thief cast a glance over his shoulder the woman was trying to disengage now her left arm hanging useless and glistening in the gaslight her opponent continued pressing silent as a ghostdont worry the man beside him said pulling him along thats corporal blues he lives for this stuffccorporalweve been covering your back coin bearer the mans other hand reached up to his collar which he turned back to reveal a brooch the names fingers sixth blade crimson guard youre being protected boy compliments of prince kazz and caladan broodcrokus stared then he scowled coin bearer whats that mean i think youve got the wrong personfingers laughed drily we figured you was walking blind and dumb boy the only explanation youve got other people trying to protect you too you know theres a coin in your pocket probably twoheaded right he grinned at the thiefs stunned expression its oponns own youve been serving a god and you didnt even know it hows your luck been lately he laughed againcrokus stopped at a gatethis is the place then fingers asked glancing at the estate rising behind the compound wall well theres a powerful mage living in there aint there well he released the thiefs arm you should be safe enough inside good luck boy and i mean that but listen fingers eyes hardened if your luck goes sour you dump that coin y hearconfusion flickered across crokuss face thank you sirour pleasure fingers said as he placed his hands in his pockets again get a move on thenthe adjunct broke away taking a cut across her right shoulder blade as she did so she ran blood spraying with the effort and the man did not pursuewhat a fool shed been thinking that the coin bearer wasnt protected but who was that man never before had she faced such a swordsman and the most appalling thing was that he had fought without the aid of sorcery for once her otataral blade and her skill had not been enoughshe staggered half blind down the street then wheeled round a corner out of the corner of her eye she saw a flash of movement the adjunct threw her back to a wall and raised her sword againa large woman stood before her regarding her quizzically looks to me she drawled like youre already doneleave me be lorn gaspedcant do it meese said we been on you since circle breaker picked you up at the gate the eel says youve got some things t pay for lady and were here to collectas soon as the woman said that the adjunct sensed another presence immediately on her left she cried out as she tried to spin into a defensive crouch and in the cry was an overwhelming sense of frustration and despair what a waste she cursed no not like thiseven as that thought thundered through her head both women attacked she parried the blade coming at her from the left but could only watch in horror as the woman whod spoken revealed two blades both driving for her chestthe adjunct screamed in rage as the weapons punched into her her sword clanged and bounded as it struck the cobbles hands groping lorn slid down the wall who she managed a blind need behind the word whoone of the women bent low over her whats thatanguish filled lorns face the corners of her mouth drooping as her eyes closed who she asked again who is this eellets go meese the woman said ignoring the body at her feetparan found her sprawled on the grimy cobbles of an alleymouthsomething had drawn him to her unerringly a final closing of the mysterious link between them her sword was beside her the grip slick with blood its edges gouged and nicked the captain crouched beside heryou made it a hard fight he whispered for what that is worthhe watched her eyes flicker open she stared up at him as recognition arrived captain ganoesadjunctthey have killed mewhoshe managed a stained smile i dont know two women looked like thieves thugs do you see the irony ganoes paranthinlipped he noddedno glorious end for the adjunct if youd come a few minutes sooner the captain said nothing he watched the life leave lorn feeling nothing ill luck knowing me adjunct im sorry for that then he collected the otataral sword and slipped it into his scabbardabove him two voices spoke in unison you gave him our swordhe straightened to find himself facing oponn the rope took it from me to be more precisethe twins could not conceal their fear they looked upon paran with something akin to pleading cotillion spared you the sister said the hounds spared you whyparan shrugged do you blame the knife or the hand wielding itshadowthrone never plays fair the brother whined hugging himselfyou and cotillion both used mortals the captain said baring his teeth and paid for it what do you want from me sympathy helpthat otataral blade the sister saidwill not be used to do your dirty work paran finished youd best flee oponn i imagine even now cotillion has given shadowthrone the sword chance and the two are putting their heads together to plan how best to use itthe twin jesters flinchedparan laid a hand over the swords sticky grip now else i return cotillions favourthe gods vanishedthe captain drew a deep breath he turned once again to lornher armour removed she proved light in his armsthe air roared around anomander rake as he plummeted but he made no other sound his warren drawn in tight around him below now sweeping lazy circles over darujhistan was the dun dragonrakes equal in size with the power to matchbut it was a fool hunting for him in the streets belowrake carefully spread his wings angling towards the galayn lord his hind limbs reached down talons spreading he drew in the air around him preparing for a burst of power he was kurald galain tiste and and darkness was his homethe galayn lord was immediately beneath him now growing larger with incredible speed rake opened his mouth head snapping back as he bit into a wall of air this sound brought the dun dragons gaze upward but it was already too latechapter twentyfouri am the house imprisoning in my birth demonic hearts so locked in each chamber some trembling enraged antiquityand these roots of stone spread the deepest cracks in parched ground holding for ever the dream of fruit ah pilgrims come to my door and starvei azath iadaephon bthe compound beyond the gate was empty crokus ran across it wondering if he was too late he bounded up the steps and reached cowfoor the door latch a burst of energy flung him backwardsdazed the thief found himself sitting on the paving stones before the steps his flesh tingling at the door a deep crimson glow slowly fadeda ward hood he hissed climbing to his feet hed run into barriers like these before in the higher estates there was no way to get through themcursing again crokus whirled and raced to the gate he emerged on to the street and looked around seeing no one if those crimson guard still protected him they werent showing themselvesthere was a slight chance that the garden entrance to baruks estate was unguarded by magica very slight chance he ran down the street and turned into the first alley to his right thered be a wall to scale but he did not consider that much of an obstaclehe came to the alleys end and skidded to a halt on the street beyondthe wall was high he saw hed need a running start crokus trotted across the street trying to catch his breath what was the point of all this couldnt baruk take care of himself after all wasnt he a high mage and hadnt even fingers commented on the alchemists sorcerous defenceshe hesitated scowling at the wall opposite himat that moment a piercing earthshaking scream was loosed directly above the street crokus threw himself against the wall behind him as an enormous shape descended into the gaslight filling the street it struck the ground less than twenty yards to the thiefs left he was thrown from his feet by the impact stones shatteredhe ducked beneath the hail of bricks and cobbles then as the scatter of rubble diminished he jumped to his feeta dragon its wings tattered and streaked with blood slowly regained its feet in the street wagging its massive wedgeshaped head from side to side along its brown flanks scales had been torn away revealing deep puncture wounds its neck and shoulders glistened with bloodcrokus saw that the wall beyond itbarukshad been obliterated opening the garden to his view snapped tree trunks rose amid steaming earth a raised patio marked the approach of the estates back entrancetwo toppled statues lay in pieces before the doorsthe dragon looked stunned crokus tensed now was the time to move almost disbelieving his own temerity the thief darted into the street behind the creature hoping to reach the cover of the garden his gaze remained on the dragon as he ran his thoughts on the coin of luck in his pocketthen before his eyes the creatures shape changed drawing into itself in a shimmering haze crokus slowed then stopped unable to pull away his attention his heart hammered against his ribs as if seeking escapeeach drawn breath was a painful gasp his luck he told himself in terror had just endedthe shimmering faded and a giant manshaped apparition now stood on the street cloaked and cowledcrokus tried to will himself to move but his body refused to obey he stared eyes widening as the demon turned to him it snarled and removed an enormous axe from its belt hefting the weapon it spoke in a deep soft voice what reason to continue this it asked reasonablythe empress permits your escape lord once again she grants yougood idea the thief whispered then he frowned for the demons attention he now saw was directed past hima man spoke behind him we run no further galayna hand fell on the thiefs shoulder breaking the spell of immobilitycrokus ducked and spun to one side then looked up into shifting indigo eyes set in a black narrow faceflee mortal the silverhaired man said drawing a twohanded sword from the scabbard slung between his shoulderblades the black weapon seemed almost invisible as if it swallowed all light that found ityou were at the fte crokus blurtedthe mans eyes flickered as if seeing him for the first time coin bearer he said with a wry smile fear not brood has convinced me to spare you at least for the moment begone child his gaze returned to the galayn lord this will be a close thingi know that weapon the demon snarled dragnipurake and i smell the reek of tiama in you lord there is more of her in you than tiste and bloodcrokus backed against what remained of baruks wallthe galayn lord grinned revealing long curved canines the empress would reward your services lord youve only to say yes and this battleanomander rake stepped forward attend galaynwith a roar the demon attacked axe whistling through the air and rake whirled his sword in a circle catching the axe and adding to its momentum as the doubleblades swept past the tiste and stepped in close sword drawn back pommel against his left hip in a blur of motion he extended the blade the demon ducked and releasing one hand from the axe haft reached for rakes throat the tiste and twisted his right thrown backwards rake landed heavily on the cobblesthe demon pounced flaming weapon above its headrake regained his feet in time to catch the axe with his swords the clash of weapons sent a jolt through the air and ground the demons axe flared bright white cascading light like liquid rakes sword was swallowed in darkness devouring the lashing waves of light that struck the flagstones beneath crokuss feet tilted sickeningly as if the stones themselves had turned to soft clay overhead the stars swam wildlyrake began to launch attacks savage swings of his black weapon at first the demon held its ground delivering fierce ripostes then staggered back a step then another relentless rake pressed his attack to the mothers regret he grated between blows was light granted birth to her dismay she saw too late its corruption galayn you are the unintended victim to punishment long overduethe demon reeled beneath the blows desperately parrying every attack no longer counterattacking the light bleeding from the axe flickered dimmed flared fitfully as darkness closed in around the bladeshrieking the demon launched itself at rake as it descended over the tiste and crokus saw a streak of black burst from the demons back slicing through the cloak the axe flew from the creatures hands its fire dying as it clattered on the groundsquealing in horror the demon clawed at the sword impaling it black smoke spread in swift tendrils from the weapon engulfing the demonthe smoke twisted became chains drawing taut the galayn screamed in earnestrake regained his feet and pushed the sword through the demons chest until the hilt jammed against bone the demon sank to its knees its black eyes locking with rakes ownthe swimming stars settled the flagstones beneath the thief became solid once again though warped and twisted crokus swallowed bile his eyes fixed on the demon it seemed to collapse in on itself the chains of black smoke ever tightening pulling the creature into the sword it toppled backwards and rake drove the weapons point into the cobbled street pinning the demon then the tiste and leaned heavily on the hilt and crokus now noticed the bloodsoaked cloth surrounding rakes shoulder where the demons hand had struck wearily the tiste and swung his gaze to the thiefmove quickly he rasped the alchemist is in danger i cannot protect him now hurry coin bearercrokus whirled and ranthe death of travale third in the cabal still echoed in their thoughtsthe witch derudan had inscribed an ash circle on the floor in the centre of the chamber with baruks help she placed the two plush chairs within it and now sat smoking steadily her dark eyes following the alchemist as he pacedbaruk found himself reluctant to enter the protective circle while they would be safe there surrounded by high tennes sorcery they would not be able to counterattack should vorcan arrive more some things could penetrate the defences of magic otataral that strange rustlike ore from the tanno hills of seven cities immediately came to mind it was unlikely that vorcan would possess such material given that she was a high mage yet still baruk felt reluctant to place himself in a position where he could not use his warren against the assassinthose of the cabal derudan said slowly who are now dead yes stubborn convinced of their own invincibility no doubt they paced restless steps awaiting the assassins imminent arrivalbaruk paused to reply but was interrupted by a loud inhuman scream from outside this was followed immediately by a concussion that rattled the walls the alchemist made a move towards the doorwait derudan called from the circle appease not this curiosity baruk for vorcan will surely take advantage yesa ward was shattered baruk said my defences are breachedmore the reason for caution derudan admonished friend i plead with you join me herevery well baruk sighed moving towards her a gust of air brushed the left side of his face derudan cried out a warning even as the alchemist turnedvorcan her gloved hands glowing red surged towards baruk he raised his arms knowing full well that he would be too late at that moment however another figure appeared emerging from darkness to intercept the master assassin with a flurry of blows vorcan reeled back then lashed out with a hand catching her attacker a glancing blowan agonized shriek rang through the chamber baruk stared only now realizing that his protector was a tiste and woman he stepped aside lithely as she flew past him to strike the floor then the wall where she lay unmoving the alchemist pulled his gaze back to vorcan seeing that one of her hands no longer glowedhe gestured and virulent sorcery erupted from his arm arcing yellow lightning vorcan hissed a counterspell and the lightning was swallowed by a red haze before her that dimmed quickly then disappeared she advancedvaguely baruk heard the witch derudan shouting at him yet it was the mistress of the assassins deathfilled eyes that held him the ease with which shed dispelled his power made it clear that she was his master in sorcery all he could do now he understood with clarity was await his deathbut baruk heard a grunt behind him then vorcan gasped the hilt of a dagger protruded from the assassins chest frowning she reached for it then pulled it out and tossed it asideall the alchemist heard the tiste and woman gasp from the floor behind him  all i can do my apologies lordderudan appeared behind vorcan as she raised her hands and began an incantation vorcan whirled and something sped from her hand the witch grunted then crumpledanguish flooded baruk with a wordless roar he launched himself at vorcan she laughed and ducked to one side throwing out her glowing hand the alchemist twisted offbalance narrowly avoiding the killing touch then staggered past he heard her laughter again as she moved in a dozen feet in front of baruk was the door the alchemists eyes widened to find it open a youth crouched there holding bricks expecting at any moment to feel vorcans touch baruk threw himself forward he saw the boy straighten at the same time and thrust forward first his right arm then his left as the alchemist fell towards the floor two bricks flew over him he heard them strike the woman behind him one making a crunching sound the other crackling a flash of red as he struck the floor the breath was hammered from baruks lungsagonized seconds passed as he struggled to draw air into his tortured chest he rolled on to his back vorcan he saw lay motionless almost against his feet the boys face came into view streaked with sweat brow e boy sighed then grinned youre alive good rallick sent me to baruk sat up the witch he said hoarsely he pointed tend to her he felt his strength returning as he watched the boy crouch beside her shes breathing crokus announced theres some kind of knife in her looks like its covered in paralt he reached down to touch itpoison the alchemist said climbing to his feet help me to her quickly a moment later he knelt beside derudan a quick glance at the saplike substance coating the blade confirmed his suspicion while baruk laid a hand on derudan your knowledge surprises me boy he said fortunately shes in the home of the one man who possesses its antidote he muttered something and a phial appeared in his hand rallick said there was no antidote to white paraltits not something im likely to announce baruk unstoppered the phial and poured the contents down the witchs throat triggering coughing fit as derudans breathing became even baruk leaned back and eyed crokus you seem well acquainted with rallick whats your namecrokus mammot was my uncle sir i saw him diederudans eyelids flickered then opened she smiled lazily what i see pleases me she said weakly yesbaruk returned the smile yes my friend but i make no claim for defeating vorcan that falls to crokus nephew of mammotderudans gaze swung to the youth ah the one i came near to treading on earlier this evening the amusement left her expression i am sorry for mammot childso am i he repliedbaruk rose and turned he hissed a vehement curse vorcans body was gone shes fled he hurried over to the tiste and woman he bent down and examined her she was dead i will soon know your name he whispered and i will remember iti have to go crokus announcedbaruk wondered at the sudden panic in the boys facei mean crokus continued if everythings over here that isi believe it is the alchemist answered i thank you crokus for your skill at throwing bricksthe boy went to the door he paused then tossed a coin into the air he caught it and grinned tightly just lucky i suppose then he was gonecaptain paran crouched beside colls bed still asleep he said rising and facing whiskeyjack go aheadkalam and the two saboteurs had arrived minutes earlier so far the sergeant mused no losses though the captains armour had taken a beating and the look in his face when hed entered the room with lorns body in his arms warned whiskeyjack away from probing parans state of mind too deeply the adjuncts body now occupied a second bed motionless and pale a strange ironic smile curving her bloodless lipsthe sergeant studied everyone in the small room the faces he knew so well all watching him waiting his gaze held on sorry or apsalar as she now called herself whatever mallet had done to her she was a changed woman from the one hed known less and somehow more as welleven mallet was unsure of what hed done certain memories skills had been freed and with them a brutal knowledge the pain was there in the womans eyes a pain layered in years of horroryet it seemed that she had it under control that shed found a way a strength to live with what shed been her only words upon meeting him had been i wish to return home sergeanthe had no objection though he wondered how she planned to cross two continents and the ocean between them whiskeyjack reached for the wrapped forearm bones lying on the table yes sir he said in answer to parans commandthe hot sweaty air in the room thickened with tension whiskeyjack hesitated thered been a battle in darujhistans streets and quick ben had confirmed the galayn lords death in fact the black wizard seemed still in shock the sergeant sighed under his breath and massaged his newly healed leg then drove the forearms blade into the tabletopcontact was immediate high fist dujeks gravelly voice filled the room about time whiskeyjack dont bother telling me about the galayn lordtayschrenns in a coma or something everyone in headquarters heard his scream so anomander rake took out the beastwhat elsewhiskeyjack glanced at paran who nodded deferentially adjunct lorns gambit failed the sergeant said shes dead we have her body with us the intersections remain minedwere not detonating them high fist since theyre likely to open the gas caverns beneath the city and turn us all into ash so he drew a deep breath feeling a twinge from his legmallet had done what he could and thatd been a lot but some damage remained and it made him feel fragile so he repeated softly were pulling out high fistdujek was silent then he grunted problems whiskeyjack one were about to lose pale as i suspected caladan brood left the crimson guard to handle things up north and marched down here with his tiste and hes also got rhivi with him and jorricks barghast whove just finished chewing up gold moranth two it gets worse the high fist swallowed audibly seven cities is maybe a week away from open rebellion the empress knows it some claw from genabaris arrived half an hour ago looking for tayschrenn my people got to him firstwhiskeyjack he was carrying a handwritten message from the empress to tayschrenn ive just been outlawed by the empire its official and tayschrenn was to have effected my arrest and execution were on our own friendthe room was silent whiskeyjack closed his eyes briefly understood high fist so when do you marchseems the black moranth are with usdont ask why anyway i have a parley at dawn tomorrow with caladan brood and kallor that will decide matters i suspect either he lets us walk or he kills us taking pale everythings riding on what he knows about the pannion seerwhiskeyjack said were rendezvousing with some black moranth in a couple of days high fist makes me wonder how much theyd guessed when that arrangement was made anyway theyll take us to you wherever you areno dujek replied we may be under siege here the black will drop you off on the catlin plain their orders are clear on this but youre welcome to try overruling themthe sergeant grimaced not likely catlin plain it is just means itll take us longer to get to you sirthe glow surrounding the bones flickered briefly and they heard an echoing thump fiddler chuckled dujek had just pounded a fist on the table at his end of the conversationwhiskeyjack shot the saboteur a ferocious lookcaptain paran dujek bellowedhere high fist paran replied stepping forwardwhat im about to say is to whiskeyjack but i want you to hear it captainim listeningsergeant if you want to be in my army youd better get used to the new order first im placing the bridgeburners under captain parans command second youre not a sergeant any more whiskeyjack you are my secondincommand and that means responsibilities i dont want you anywhere near pale and you know im right dammit captain paranyeswhiskeyjacks squad has earned the right to walk understood if any of them elect to rejoin the bridgeburners fine but i dont want any recriminations if they decide otherwise i trust thats clearyes high fistand with whiskeyjack between commissions dujek continued inexorably hes just coming along for the ride if you follow me captainparan grinned i donow the black moranth will know the story by the time they pick you up so go with themyes high fistdujek growled questions whiskeyjackno the grizzled veteran answered glumlyall right hopefully well talk laterthe bones glow diedcaptain paran rounded on the soldiers he studied each face they were to have been my command i could not have done better anywherevery well he said gruffly who is ready to be outlawed and counted among dujeks rebelstrotts was the first to rise his teeth bared he was followed by quick ben hedge and malletey reed i there was a shocked silence then kalam nodded at fiddler and cleared his throat were with you only were not going with you me and fiddler that iscan you explain that paran asked quietlyapsalar spoke up surprising everyone theyll find that hard to do captain and i admit im not sure what theyre up to but theyre coming with me back to the empire homewith an uneasy shrug fiddler rose and faced whiskeyjack we feel we owe it to her sir he said he looked to the captain and were settled on it sir but were coming back if we canbemused whiskeyjack pushed himself painfully to his feet as he turned to face paran he froze behind the captain coll sat upright on the bed um whiskeyjack said gesturingtension burgeoned in the room once again as everyone swung to collparan stepped forward in genuine reliefcoll im he stopped abruptly then said tonelessly youve been awake for some time i seecolls eyes flicked to the bones stuck in the tabletop then returned to paran heard it all he said so tell me paran do you soldiers need any help getting out of darujhistanrallick stood in the darkness beneath the trees at the edge of the gladeit seemed that his magicdeadening powers had proved insufficient after all hed been driven from his seat by what had felt like a giant handa gods hand sure and powerful and unyielding hed watched in astonishment as a maze of roots clambered swiftly across the clearing headed towards the terrace hed heard a shriek then the roots returned wrapped around a manshaped apparition which the roots pulled unceremoniously into the earthrallick had been filled suddenly with neareuphoria he knew with unaccountable certainty that what grew here was right and justit was new young even now as he continued watching it he saw trembles of shaping ripple beneath its angular geometric surfaces what had been no more than a tree stump less than an hour ago was now a house a massive door lay half buried in shadows beneath an arching branch vines barred shuttered windows a balcony hung above and to the left of the door festooned with leaves and creepers it led into a kind of tower turreted above the second storey and shingled to a gnarled peak another tower marked the houses front right flank this one stockier and windowless its roof flat with jagged merlons lining the edge he suspected that this roof was a platform with access through a trapdoor of some kindthe glade around the structure had changed too becoming mounded here and there as if the houses yard was a burial ground young scraggly trees ringed each oblong mound each growing as if an invisible wind twisted them away from the humped grassy earth the roots had dragged the apparition into one such moundit felt right and just these two words echoed in the assassins head with an appeal that wrapped calm around his heart he almost imagined he felt an affinity with this childhouseas if it knew of him and accepted himhe knew the house to be empty another sourceless certaintyrallick continued watching as the lines of the house grew firm sharply defined a musty smell pervaded the area as of freshly turned earth the assassin felt at peacea moment later he heard thrashing behind him and whirled to see vorcan stagger through the undergrowth her face was covered in blood from a gash to her brow and she nearly collapsed into rallicks armstiste and she gasped after me hunting they seek to avenge a murderrallick looked past her and his eyes long accustomed to the surrounding darkness detected silent movement among the trees closing in he hesitated gripping the now unconscious woman in his arms then he bent down threw vorcan over one shoulder turned and ran towards the househe knew that the door would open for him and it did beyond was a dark antechamber and an archwayleading into a hallway running from side to side a gust of warm sweet air flowed over rallick and he entered without pausekorlat bloodkin to serrat slowed as she approached the strange house the door had closed behind their quarry she came to the edge of the clearing then squatted on her haunches her fellow hunters gathered slowly around herhorult hissed angrily then said have you summoned our lord korlatthe woman shook her head i know of such creations from old she said the deadhouse of malaz city the odhanhouse of seven cities azath edieimarn pillars of innocencethis door will not open to usyet it opened to them horult saidthere is precedence the azath choose their own it was so with the deadhouse two men were chosen one who would be emperor the other who would accompany him kellanved and danceri sense its power orfantal whispered our lord could destroy it now while its still youngyes agreed korlat he could she was silent a moment then she rose i am bloodkin to the fallen she saidyou are bloodkin the others intonedthe quest for vengeance is ended korlat said the lines around her almondshaped eyes tightening our lord will not be summoned leave him to his recovery the azath will not be touched for it is new a childher eyes soft brown slowly regarded those of her companions the queen of darkness spoke thus of light when it was first born it is new and what is new is innocent and what is innocent is precious observe this child of wonder and know respectorfantal scowled thus did light survive and so was darkness destroyed the purity vanquishedand now you would have us flawed as our queen was flawed light became corrupted and destroyed our world korlat or have you forgottenkorlats smile was a sad one cherish such flaws dear sister for our queens was hope and so is mine now we must leavekruppes expression was benign as he watched crokus approach clearly exhausted by this night of endless running he nudged murillio and fluttered his fingers in the young thiefs direction the lad returns with undue haste yet i fear such sad tidings as kruppe must bringhes had a rough night all around murillio commented he leaned against the gates support wall outside the sinital estate the streets remained empty the citizens shocked numb with the nights horrorskruppe gestured at moons spawn now a league to the west well beyond the citys walls a remarkable contraption that however kruppe is pleased that it has chosen to depart imagine even the stars blotted out leaving naught but dread in this worldi need a drink murillio mutteredexcellent idea kruppe said shall we await the lad howeverthe wait was not long crokus recognized them and slowed his frantic run apsalars been kidnapped by the empire he shouted i need help he wobbled to a halt before murillio and rallicks still in the gardentut tut kruppe said easy lad apsalars location is known to kruppe as for rallick well he faced the street and waved his arms expansively breathe the night air crokus a new year has begun come let us walk the three of us masters of darujhistan he linked arms with his comrades and pulled them forwardmurillio sighed rallicks missing he explained theres some kind of extraordinary house in colls garden nowah so much unveiled in that single statement kruppe leaned against crokus while no doubt the lads secret overriding concern at the moment regards the fate of a fair young maiden whose life was saved at the last moment by a nobleson named gorlas of all things saved kruppe says from a ton of masonry shrugged off a wall twas heroic indeed the lass nearswooned with satisfactionwhat are you talking about crokus demanded who was savedmurillio snorted i think dear kruppe master of darujhistan youve got the wrong fair maiden in mindshes not fair anyway crokus assertedkruppes chest swelled slightly you need but ask the gods lad and theyll tell that life itself isnt fair now are you interested in how lady sinitals estate has just this night become colls estate or is your mind so thoroughly enamoured of this new love of yours that even the fates of your dearest friendskruppe includedyield such lack of interestcrokus bridled of course im interestedthen the story begins as always with kruppe murillio groaned thus spake the eelepiloguei have seen a rumour born swathed in snug mystery left lying under the sun in the hills of the gadrobi where the sheep have scattered on wolfladen winds and the herds have fled a whispering of sands and it blinked in the glare a heart hardened into stone whilst the shadow of the gates of nowhere crept cross the drifting dust of home i have seen this rumor born a hundred thousand hunters of the heart in a city bathed in blue lightrumour born i iivfisherwhen sun lit the morning mists into a shield of white over the lake down on the beach a fisherboat rocked in the freshening waves unmoored it was moments before pulling free of the pebblesmallet helped whiskeyjack to a dome of rock above the beach where they sat the healers gaze hesitated on the figure of quick ben standing with shoulders hunched and staring across the lake he followed the wizards gaze moon spawn hung low on the horizon a gold cast to its ravaged basalt mallet grunted its heading south i wonder what that meanswhiskeyjack squinted against the glare he began to massage his templesmore headaches mallet askednot so bad lately the grizzled man saidits the leg that worries me the healer muttered i need to work on it some more and you need to stay off it awhilewhiskeyjack grinned as soon as theres time he saidmallet sighed well work on it thenfrom the forested slope behind them hedge called theyre coming inthe healer helped whiskeyjack stand hell he whispered it couldve been a lot worse right sergeantwhiskeyjack glared across the lake three lost aint that bad consideringa pained expression crossed mallets face he said nothinglets move whiskeyjack growled captain paran hates tardiness and maybe the moranth have good news be a change wouldnt itfrom the beach quick ben watched mallet supporting his sergeant up the slope was it time he wondered to stay alive in this business no one could afford to let up the best plans work inside other plans and when its right to feint feint big keeping the other hand hidden is the hard partthe wizard felt a stab of regret no it wasnt time give the old man a chance to rest he forced himself into motion he wouldnt let himself look backnever a good idea the scheme was hatchedwhiskeyjacks going to howl when he hears this one he whispered to himselfcaptain paran listened to the others on the beach below but made no move to join them not yet his brush with ascendants seemed to have left him with a new sensitivityor perhaps it was the otataral sword scabbarded at his side but he could sense her now already in her adolescence plump as he knew shed be smiling with her heavylidded eyes deceptively sleepy as she studied the morning skyi will come to you he promised her when this pannion seer and his cursed holy war is crushed i will come to you then tattersaili knowhe stiffened that voice in his head had not been his own or had ithe waited waited for more tattersail only silence answered him ah my imagination nothing more to think you would call up enough of your old life to find the feelings you once held for me find them and feel them once again i am a foolhe rose from his crouch at lorns gravesidea mound of rocksand brushed twigs and orange pine needles from his clothing look at me now agent for the adjunct once now a soldier finally a soldiersmiling he made his way down to his squadthen i shall await the coming of a soldierparan stopped in his tracks then smiling continued on now that he whispered was not my imaginationthe tradecraft hugged the southern shore making for dhavran and the river mouth kalam leaned on the gunwale his gaze sweeping the north horizons ragged snowcapped mountains near him stood another passenger hardly memorable and disinclined to talkthe only voices reaching the assassin came from apsalar and crokusthey sounded excited each revolving around the other in a subtle dance that was yet to find its accompanying words a slow half smile quirked kalams mouth itd been a long time since hed heard such innocencea moment later crokus appeared beside him his uncles demon familiar clutching his shoulder coll says that the empires capital unta is as big as darujhistan is itkalam shrugged maybe a lot uglier i dont expect well have a chance to visit it though itko kan lies on the south coast while unta is on kartool bay the northeast coast miss darujhistan alreadyan expression of regret came over crokuss face he stared down into the waves just some people there he saidthe assassin grunted know how you feel crokus hell look at fiddler back there mooning away as if somebody had cut off one of his arms and one of his legsapsalar still cant believe youd go to all this trouble for her she doesnt remember being much liked in your squadwasnt her though was it this woman here is a fishergirl from some twocopper village and shes a long way from homeshes more than that crokus muttered he had a coin in his hand and was playing with it absentlykalam threw the boy a sharp look really he said deadpancrokus nodded affably he held up the coin and examined the face on it do you believe in luck kalamno the assassin growledcrokus grinned happily me neither he flipped the coin into the airthey watched it plummet into the sea flash once then vanish beneath the wavesfrom near the bow circle breaker slowly nodded to himself the eel would be delighted with the news not to mention greatly relieved then he returned his attention to the west and wondered what it would be like no longer anonymous to the world
